Socially awkward at work,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I'm naturally a quiet, polite person in professional settings - it's just how I can get by. When I'm in the workplace, I turn extra quiet/polite because it's a professional environment. However, the reactions I get from people when I talk make me think I come across as really weird, or ""fake"" because I'm not being authentic - my responses are just on the polite or quiet side - quite agreeable.  I just don't want to offend anyone, and I don't have the energy to try and be my true self, because I get so caught up in cringing at what I do say. I work with people who are loud, full of banter, smart but definitely more on the loud side, and unafraid to say what's on their mind. I've been the target of bullying from people in better roles than me when I first started at my job and that severely knocked my confidence down, I felt isolated and I still do. I was outcasted by them, and am still outcasted. I got a promotion recently but I feel it was out of pity because I've been there for two years, and my predecessor was ""loved"" by everyone because of their outgoing, bubbly, and banter nature - everything I'm not. They all miss this person, and being her quiet replacement makes me feel awful, it's really obvious the difference in how much they liked this person and not me. I get stomach knots thinking about going to work, even WFH is hard because of the meetings. I say cringe things, or reactions make me feel like I do, and don't let myself live them down. I wonder if I will always feel like this, no matter what workplace I go to? I HATE feeling sorry for myself, but I feel so stuck.  I don't know if this is social anxiety, or if it's just common nerves most people get being in an environment they don't feel comfortable in - despite being there for years. New people come and go and I still aren't able to form a real connection with them, and it makes me think I'm the problem. I try my best to be nice, friendly and laugh at others jokes and ask them questions about themselves, but yeah just feeling extremely isolated and like a complete joke and fraudster.

"If someone close to you, specially a family member has a disorder such as schizophrenia/bipolar/borderline how do you ~separate~ the person from the disorder?",0,False,False,True,False,2,False,"(trigger warning- mention of abuse/violence) 


Hi. F, in early 20s. My dad is a diagnosed schizophrenic, and where I'm from there's little acknowledgement of mental health issues let alone proper treatment. considering that my dad is 60+, you can imagine how much worse it was for him growing up. I don't think he's getting adequate treatment now either but I can't do much about it as it's in my mother's hands. I grew up in a dysfunctional, abusive household watching my parents physically, mentally and emotionally abuse each other and also my younger sibling and I. They both seem to have generational trauma from their families, and my mom has a major Narcissistic personality with other behavioral issues. Needless to say I have extremely unhealthy relationships with both my parents. 

With little to no knowledge about dad's schizophrenia, my mom, her side of the family and some parts of dad's family labeled him crazy and encouraged us (my sibling and I) to do the same. we grew up understanding that he's evil and malicious. I believe they're both in the wrong in many different ways. Now I can assume from common sense and stories I've heard that my dad was the general instigator of this cycle of abuse between the two of them because of his schizophrenia. But my mom not knowing what's wrong with him for the first few years of their marriage obviously took it differently and further aggravated him. Which led him to act out even more. Growing up, even though the first few years of my life I had a sweet, emotional bond with my dad, as he started acting out more and more I started to get scared of him and eventually hated him. his behavior towards me, my younger sibling and specially my mom slowly made me despise him. there were times when he would be beating my mom mercilessly and my little sibling and I would try to break them up or worse, hit him to make him stop. I remember this one time he strangled her so badly she was unconscious for hours.

I've gotten in countless arguments with my dad where I've tried to size him up for the sake of my mom, sibling and I. It's been confusing. Because when he's in a good/ ""normal"" mood, I seem to be his favorite person in the world. I've always had a soft spot for him regardless of all the disgust and resentment. Even as a child when things weren't properly explained to me I understood that what he does is sometimes out of his control. My mom treated me like shit for the apparent soft spot I had/have. Then again she herself has switched between despising him and taking care of him like a baby this entire time. And I've grown up switching sides when it came to defending my parents. I tried to stand up for whatever seemed logical to me. But I didn't know anything for sure. That's the issue, I never understood anything fully, didn't know who to trust, who to listen to. This has lead me to distance myself from my dad as much as possible. Couldn't ignore my mom because I'm dependant on her, while my dad is dependant on us.

I still talk to him but I'm not sweet like I once used to be. over the years my tone towards him has turned more and more indifferent and somewhat rude. I mostly just talk to him if it's necessary now. An important piece of information: he had a brain stroke a couple of years ago which changed him drastically. I think 1) because the thing paralyzed him, limited his speech and movement, made him more codependent and 2) because this time around he was properly diagnosed and treated for the first time.
It was extremely hard for us as a family to cope with the stroke but after the first few years things got way better than they were before the stroke. He is now medicated and ten times calmer.

And I'm older now, know more than I did before. Still very traumatized but it seems like there's more time, space and sanity for me to take everything about my dad into consideration and revaluate how I treat him. My automatic, gut reaction to him is pretty rude and indifferent, like I said. Often I lose my patience and snap at him when he whines for something he needs. If he's just trying to talk or be nice I keep it short and simple and try to be nice or neutral. I can't just forget everything he's done to our family. All the harm he's caused. But I also know he's mentally ill and it's not 100% his fault. I'd also like to add a small but important info that he had inappropriately flashed our maid during his first stages of recovering from the stroke. when it comes to things like this my judgement is truly clouded. where does the mental illness end and where does the person begin? I just want to be fair. Nothing more, nothing less. If you have thoughts, advice, own experiences, please feel free to share. DMs are open too. Thank you. Have a nice day.

Can anyone relate to this?,2,True,False,True,False,4,False,"I'm not sure how to really articulate this, so if this doesn't make sense I'm sorry in advance.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD a few years ago, and ADHD last year. I deal with distressing ruminating thoughts about things that I care about, making me unable to enjoy them. It's almost like anything that I don't really have to concentrate too hard on my brain makes me ruminate about, like it's a machine constantly working on overdrive. I'm now on zoloft which I've been on for two years, and ritalin which I started this year.

The medication has helped to an extent, the anxiety symptoms are less prominent, the rumination isn't quite as strong and I'm functioning better in terms of ADHD stuff. But what hasn't gone away is my inability to relax.

I'll try to explain it:

I can't fully enjoy anything. Whenever I do something I love, my brain works too hard. I don't know how to explain it, maybe it's agitation? Some kind of energy in my brain. I'll give some examples:

1. I went to a concert and saw one of my all time favourite bands. They were absolutely INCREDIBLE, and I had a great night. However, even though I had a great night and everything was perfect, I had this energy in my brain that stopped me from being able to relax. I tried anchoring my thoughts to stay present, breathing etc. but I realise now that I was present, and I wasn't anxious, so this didn't really work. This meant I wasn't really able to have fun to a full extent, like I did, but couldn't relax? It's hard to explain.
2. My passion is music. Whenever I make music, I enjoy it, but this 'agitation' stops me from having fun. Like, I enjoy it, and I can feel myself enjoying it but I can't have fun, because the other half of me is feeling like this.

Sometimes there's thoughts attached to this energy in my brain, for example at the concert I was worried about the fact that I messed up a few lyrics, I know how silly that is and it didn't even bother me, but it was something that my brain could attach itself to to ruminate. Other times though, there's no thoughts attached, also like the concert where I used my strategies to work through that worry, but the feeling was still there, also when I'm making music I feel it even without thinking something.

It's like my brain NEEDS to churn over something. It needs to take relaxation away, meaning everything I love is rendered not very fun, even if it's something I'm enjoying. It's so hard to explain, like there's this feeling on one side and enjoyment on the other. It's like there's energy inside my brain, not anxiety because I don't feel it physically. UGH I can't explain it.

I feel like I'm running out of hope. I can't take this anymore and I just want to relax and have fun without this torment. I've tried mindfulness which has helped to calm anxiety and keep me present, I've tried breathing which has done the same, I've tried exposure therapy which has made OCD lose it's effect a bit, but whatever this is can't seem to be beaten. It's not that I'm anxious, it's not that I'm not present. Maybe it's that I'm on high alert? Under pressure? My brain feels like it's on overdrive and it won't stop.

I guess the best way to describe it is my brain feels uncomfortable all of the time.

Pressures from school feed it too, I get a similar feeling from that where I want to relax but I'm worried about what I need to do. That's not the only cause like I said, it's just something else I thought I should mention. Like all Sunday I'm frustrated and thinking about how I need to go to school the next day. I know that sounds like anxiety and probably is though. I think it's just another thing that my brain attaches itself to like I was saying earlier. It's like it wants to think about something so that I can't relax.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. Please comment if you have anything that should be clarified.

Can anyone give me some insight on what I'm experiencing, or does anyone relate and can maybe help me to articulate it better? I'm seeing a psychologist regularly but it's more focused on anxiety and ADHD.

I feel trapped,2,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Hi. I am dealing with some stuff and I've seen countless doctors and had scans, labs, and therapy. None of that is working so after lurking in this page I've decided to post and see if anyone out there is dealing with the same or something similar or found a ""cure"". Here's some back story, I've dealt with intermittent anxiety in my teen years but for the most part everything was fine in my adult life. I love to be in high stress environments like debates, skydiving, and impulsive reckless things. However, December of '22 I  start to have what we believe were dissociative episodes. It would happen when I was driving or talking to someone and I wouldn't be able to remember what the hell happened during. I naturally go to the ER a doctor (bad one) tells me I might have a tumor, so we do a CT which shows nothing. He says we should do an MRI but I have to schedule elsewhere which doesn't have availability until February. Naturally this makes the episodes worse. I check into a different ER and beg for an MRI. I get one and it shows a 7mm lesion on my pineal gland and wouldn't cause these episodes. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me so I break down, call out of work go to another doctor and sob with my father since I couldn't even trust myself to drive at this point. I get hydroxyzine and life is ok again. Until....my honeymoon. April '23, I'm in Dublin second floor of a souvenir shop, with my amazing husband on facetime with my mom, I throw him the phone because all of a sudden I NEED to get out of there or I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Then I get outside and I'm ok. Things are normal again. Then July comes, husband is visiting me (we live apart as he is active duty air force stationed in England and I am in Minnesota for work) and every day I am in these episodes so I see the doctor from December and get Xanax, doesn't work and eventually makes things worse because I start worrying about the side effects like if it's been long enough since I took it to drive etc... So then I meet with doctor we start Prozac still nothing. I also during this period learn episodes are especially prevalent if I'm eating or drinking alcohol and I feel the anxiety in my throat armpits and chest. Like I'm gonna hurl. I visit my husband in Oct '23 and no episodes except when I had a sip of a martini. We also didn't really leave the house to really trigger any episodes but it was reassuring to know he was not the catalyst. So eventually I give up on this doctor because nothing is working. I start to think I am agoraphobic but I get groceries and run errands and things just fine. I recently in the last two months started seeing a psychiatrist who at first prescribed Lexapro but it made me terribly ill. I switched to Buspar 15 mg twice a day and I thought maybe it was working. Husband came and visited and during the 3 weeks I had a few major episodes and completely skipped dinner with my boss in fear of the embarrassment of not eating etc, didn't eat at Christmas, and wouldn't go out to eat at all. So nothing that could cause the episodes. I feel like my life has been stolen from me. I am truly miserable. I LOVE people, I LOVE to be social but since December of '22 I avoid it like the plague. Last Thursday I got a haircut and it has left residual anxiety until today even. I had a VERY bad episode. And to clarify it's all internal. Most people don't even know it's happening. My breathing is fine, heart rate is fine, but internally my mind is RACING and my legs are week, hands clammy, the works. It feels like someone is pointing a gun at me and I just have to deal with it. I want to enjoy life again. I want to start a family with my husband, I want to want to live life. I am tired of feeling trapped. So my question is has anyone else dealt with this? If so what helped? Has anyone tried Beta Blockers for this? My Doc wants to try Gabapentin but I am worried I'll be a mindless zombie. This really is a cry for help so any advice is helpful.

I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile.,250,False,False,True,False,30,True,"Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife.

now months later we are friends but its so different.  i feel the crazy comfort is gone. she leaned on me for a lot of stuff, we cried together, i hung out at her place till wee hours of the morning. we always texted each other quickly, made time for each other.

now we talk and such but all the super closeness is gone.  i find its causing me anxiety or maybe a despair at what i feel we have lost?

a big weight here is she really showed me who i want to be in a relationship. i had quite a few firsts with her emotionally and from a comfort stand point. 

the point of this is that im hung up on a friendship that i want to be as it was, when there is a good chance it wont. id like to feel safe and comfortable again with her and it would seem im willing to do just about anything to work towards that.  seems extreme for a friendship?

My sister is very messy and can’t get rid of things. I often have to house and dog sit for her. It’s not enjoyable. If I bring the mess topic up, she gets very defensive. 

However, if I leave one small thing of mine in a big mess of her clutter she notices it right away. As a test the other day for superbowl. I left one Pepsi mini can on her island of clutter and she noticed right away. 

For context she has garbage, recycling, old food, dirty dishes and clothes piled up on her island. But she zeroes in on the one thing that dose not belong there. 

She’s like “what is this doing here?!” And seems a little annoyed that it’s there. 

Which is so odd to me. It’s so messy already but if I leave one little thing behind she dose not like it. 

Any thoughts??

My Girlfriend’s brain was rewired from greening out on weed…,0,False,False,True,False,17,False,"Hello i’m here in crisis looking for anyone with relation to what is going on with my girlfriend. It was around a month ago probably the beginning of December when this had all happened. We were laying in bed and we took a hit out of a pen. Only 1 for the each of us. All was good we were just watching a movie and then all of a sudden she says she’s going to throw up. She runs to the bathroom and pukes and I follow helping her and holding her hair and afterwards she felt a lot better and she just wanted to go to sleep so I helped you lay down and get some sleep and went home. 

All throughout the night she would wake up and have panic attacks and horrible anxiety and a very hard time breathing. She moved to her sisters room in case something really bad happened and Called her dad at some point too to talk to him about what was going on. I was asleep throughout all of this and was very worried by morning time because I had school the next day. 

After I got done with school she was still sleeping and back into her bed so she must’ve moved at some point and I woke her up and talked to her about how she was feeling and stuff like that. She seemed normal for a day or 2 like how she would usually act maybe a little more anxious than usual but after about 4-5 it really started to get bad. 

From 4 days after to now it’s only gotten worse or the same nothing has improved with her mental health. Especially when she has to go to her dorm away from home it gets really bad for her and she cannot function and just breakdowns without any second thought. She feels as if she cannot do anything about it.

 She doesn’t want to feel this anymore and will do anything to stop it. She’s on an anxiety medication and her therapist says she can’t give her all the support she needs right now for her crisis. 

If anyone has any relation to this story or recommendations on what we could do to improve by any means please let me know and help.

My older cousin tried to f me?? I'm honestly not so sure but it creeps tf outta me..,9,True,False,True,False,9,False,"This happened when I was 16yo and him being 21 it was 2 years ago (2022). During the holidays I had to stay at my other parent's house and every time we have a family dinner we went to my grandma's house (it was near our house that I could just walk there by myself). That day my mom told me to come to my grandma's house to help my aunt with cooking and I did. My mom's brother and his wife anddd their two sons live together with my grandma. After we finished eating our lunch together, my mom and my aunt like all of them went to a wedding. Before that she asked me if I wanted to go with her. And I refused to go cus I'm exhausted and that I have some homework to do. Everyone went to the wedding except HIM. He had work to do but his work starts at evening until late night (I'm not sure). He was outside somewhere and came back home (my grandma's house basically his home). I was doing my homework and decided to take a break. I went upstairs to my grandma's bedroom and charged my phone. I hear someone footsteps heading upstairs and went to the other room. He then came in to my grandma's room and trying to look for something (I think he was looking for his charger). He saw me lying down on the bed. He stopped looking for it and paused for a moment. He asked me what I'm watching and I said oh just tiktok. He tries to swipe my phone and said ""let me see"". I pull the phone away from him and was like nooo cus I thought he wanted to know my tiktok account. He tried to convince me to let him "" c'mon let me seee"" but I refuse bcus I don't want him to see my tt acc. I was shy. Then he just jumped right next to me on the bed. He gets closer and closer to me. I was still watching tiktok and he tries to take away my phone. He told me ""let's watch a movie"" and I was like ""no I don't wanna watch a movie.."" HE TRIES TO GRAB MY PHONE AGAIN AND TELL ME TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH HIM. I was frustrated inside and I keep watching tiktok. He gave up but still lying on the bed beside me and watch me watching tiktok..But then I feel super uncomfy when he puts his hands on my upper thighs to my waist and then to my chest omg. That's when I suspected something is off I felt super uncomfy realising that bad things is going to happen if I don't get out of the bed quick. I kinda started to panick and gets up, pull my charger and told him ""I'm going down stairs"". He asked me ""is your battery full?? "" I REPLIED WITH THE MOST STUPIDEST THING EVER ""yeah it's full I'm going down"" WELL NO SHIT OBVIOUSLY HE'S WATCHING YOUR PHONE THE WHOLE TIME SMH. my phone battery needed a life support it was like on 26% sumthn like that but I was desperate to leave. I went to the living room and sit on the couch and immediately try to call my mom. I wanted to ask her when is she coming back. But she didn't pick up her phone and he went down too approaching me and I try to hide the fact that I was trying to call my mom from him. I get up and desperately text my bsf""can I call youuu???? I'm in trouble rn"", sum like that. He asked me what am i doing. I told him I'm texting my bsf. He took a chair and told me sit beside him and I'm like "" waittt"" THEN HE JUST GRABBED MY WRIST AND MAKE ME SIT DOWN ON THE CHAIR. I was still texting my bsf like SPAMMING HER PLEASE ANSWER MY CALLS I NEED YOU. I needed her to calm me down but she didn't pick up yet. Then I open my Instagram scrolling randomly but my hands just won't stop shaking I tried so hard to hide it from him. He just started to wrap his left arm to my waist as he kept watching me being on my phone. Then he tries to touch me on my chest AGAIN. My bsf called me she saw my spams and I quickly answered it and we were jokingly laughing talking about random shit I was legit still shaking in fear and then i got up and kept talking to my bsf and said I wanna go to the bathroomm. As soon as I went to the bathroom I locked it and explained to her everything that happened in text.  I was trying to calm down. I stepped outside, he saw me still talking to my bsf and he suddenly just fuck off somewhere else outside. It was evening I went back to my other house I had my mom's keys with me. There's my lil cousin with me he wanted to take his clothes that he left in our house. I gave it to him and there was a motorbike parked in front of the door that I didn't close. HE WENT INSIDE and saw that my lil cousin was with me. He walk pass me to the kitchen pretending to look for his other bro. He randomly asked me if I saw his other bro. And I'm like what no he's not here. Then he just fuck off and I let my lil cousin outside. I made sure I locked all the doors. Then I took a shower and rest in the room. It was getting dark I was still scrolling through my phone until I heard someone trynna open the main door with a key. I panicked and I was so sure that my keys were with me. I locked the door in the room I was in. I can still hear keys jangling and attempts to open the door. Luckily that door is strong and secure enough. Idk if I heard that right or I'm just hallucinating but it was LOUD AND CLEAR. I stayed in the room for a while but after a few hours I stepped outside and check the windows to see if there's still someone at the door. There was nobody but I highly assume it was him again. I called my mom again asking when is she coming back. She finnaly answered me and said ""in a few minutes"". After it happened I didn't tell a soul except my bsf I kinda wanted to tell my mom expecting she would do something about it and comfort me. It takes courage to do so. After a few weeks, I finnaly spoke to her about it. IT WENT SOUTH I MEAN I'M A FREAKING DUMBASS TO TRUST MY NARCISSISTIC MOM AND IT'S BASICALLY MY FAULT. At first she was shock she asked me "" where did he touch you?! "". I answered her question but then she said "" that's all the satans doings"" I'M like huh. She proceed to tell me ""you should've come with me hm."" AND ""you could just stay outside"". UH MOM?? EVEN SO THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE HE COULD LITERALLY JS GRAB ME BACK INSIDE AND WHY WOULD I STAY OUTSIDE ITS HOT ASF U TOOK DECADES TO COME BACK. I was speechless and felt sick. She made me feel like it's my fault I should've done better. I was silent and upset the whole time after she said those to me. Gosh I hate her so much she just continuing on talking and spending time with him happily like nothing happened. I didn't want to sleep in my grandma's house ever again. I felt bad that I couldn't sleep with her again she's so nice but It upsets me no one knows the truth about him.  His mom was nice but my heart sank everytime they speak highly about him.

Saw the doctor yesterday, he gave me some medication to clear up post nasal drip, listened to my chest and said it sounded clear, but they never want to say 'no, I'm sure it's not (Insert disease here)

This led to a blow up when we got home. He did plan a very nice day for me. All I do though is focus on the ring and that it could be better and I am not good enough etc.

Anytime I focus on the ring this happens. I choose most days not to wear it because I react so extreme that is not good enough.

By choosing (that part's important; it is purely your choice how you manage your time) hobbies w/ zero in-person interaction, you're CHOOSING the path of the hermit. FACTS.

Please believe that I've experienced this in my own life. 

When I led a podcast at work or was in the Navy, I was extremely social. 

When I got deep into Elden Ring or binging repeated shows, I was creating no social opportunities, and my social anxiety increased.

These are two of countless examples.

So, what do you do? You're the captain of your free time, so make sure to choose hobbies that force you to interact with people. Instead of buying a new game, join CrossFit or Karate. Instead of binging, take your dog to a popular park and interact with people.

You must create those opportunities if you want to improve socially.",False,False,socialanxiety,401691,Controversial,2023,5,Very high,2,58,1381,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0
Been deteriorating from needing love since almost dying when I got crohn's disease.,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"So I don't know all of the details, maybe it was my abusive childhood, but I (32M) made a decision when I was little that I'd wait to find love before I did anything with my life.

I've tried everything to change this over the years, but I've given up and decided that I will just have to double down on trying to find the right girl who can love me for my untapped potential. My need for love is just that overpowering. Even though I'm aromantic and have no energy, I'm still that driven.

Gotta admit, I'm pretty far gone. Definitely not desperate, as a desperate person would sacrifice their health to get the status symbols that people in R4R require to see me as attractive.

I know it would be impossible to convince an outsider, but my relationship pursuits are genuine and not perverse or selfish or crude as they blatantly seem, and as people constantly remind me. I simply know what I need and what I can offer. It boils down to companionship in the bedroom. Anything more is too much to promise or to ask for. I know that I can overcome every obstacle in my life on my own except for this one.

I guess I'm brainwashed or hypnotized, for lack of better term, to need love to such a degree that I can barely function. I believe that my depression is fully conditional on having love in my life. I have tested it by meeting a few girls in the past, but things didn't work out.

The very fact that needing love doesn't attract potential mates has me convinced that this is a world of hate that perhaps doesn't deserve anything that I could contribute to it. People should only get love if they need it, right? If a person does things to deserve your love, you have made yourself into an object, and lost your humanity. These are the types I see on dating sites all the time since I study dating profiles as a hobby I guess.

I don't even know what advice I should ask for anymore. Should I see a hypnotist to tell me I don't need love anymore? Cuz besides being a human cat pet, my remaining options all seem to involve horrible things.

This could be triggering so be wary of that.

My mother is a neglectful parent so I (20F) am basically the main caretaker of my little sister (13F)

My sister has the friend (let’s call her Sam). The situation has multiple parts to it so I’ll format them as a list:

1) My sister calls me upstairs while my mother is out of state and he and Sam are self harming and calling a hotline. I talked with my sister about it and advised my mother to get her a therapist. She did. I also said maybe her and Sam should have a break from eachother. My mother didn’t listen 

2) Sam is constantly talking about eating disorders and my sister downloaded Snapchat to talk to friends who sound way older then my sister (16-17). I tell my mother Im concerned and she dismisses me. 

3)We get a call from their school that they stole a package. The woman didn’t press charges. I say they need to stop being friends and my mom ignores me.

4) my stepdad finds them with a lighter and I get my sister to admit they were smoking. She prettended she was trying to get us to stop smoking and downloaded anti addiction apps on our phones to pull off the lie that she stole our lighters to stop us smoking. Mom gives her no consequences.

5) 40$ is missing from my wallet and tons have change has spilled into my purse. The only people who could have stolen it was Sam and my sister in that time period. I go through her room to try and find it after she denies it and find several items she stole from me and my mother and 800$ in stolen mail (luxury items) as well as notes that prove she’s cheating and empty sharpeners (SH blades). 

No consequences for stealing/cheating


6) I go through her phone because she told me to check her messages to see Sam saying she didn’t take my money and find her bullying girls, *TW* sending extremely explicit messages to Sam, planning to run away (we are moving states which upsets her), claiming she has a eating disorder (I have anorexia so that scares the hell out of me but she’s a healthy weight and doesn’t purge {I’d hear}  and says she does. She also lied about being a drug addict which I definitely know she is not), saying she’s been hospitalized (she hasn’t), and sending pictures of self harm and telling Sam to kill herself.

No consequences from my mother.

I don’t know what to do and can really use some help. When she’s around me she acts like a little angel. If I try to get her to share how she’s feeling she tells me she’s fine.

Help what do I do with myself and my brain now??,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Attempting for a perfect moment and everything good in my life to be perfectly independent is driving me insane.

Help idk what to do now
My percectionism is opposite of most I have to be perfectly loserlike and alone and independent so when I do have a moment it is purely mine. Which is easy afffff when you’re alone but driving me insane right now because I’m forced to be home since I’m a high schooler. Fuck idk. 
Plus I have to reset my school account and have a new toothbrush and school is getting remodeled and I’m ocd about these things happening and they have to happen now but I don’t want imperfection of them, however now due to missing the bus today and being driven they are imperfect and ughhhhh idk what to do like literally what do I do with myself do I give up on saving my first drink for a perfect moment and waste that on now? Idk. What should I do. Give up and be in room forever? What do I do bro.
Idek if this is ocd since it’s only about one fucking thing but it has dragged on for like years and this specific version for months. I haven’t showered for months or brushed teeth in months due to this one thing I can’t stand the idea of my parents helping or contributing anything to me like it’s an extreme form of this ocd maybe idk. But anyways there’s this moment that I’ve been building up to. For years. Life changing turn around. And I had it I “ran away (because I lied about being with others)” to Georgia and it was this whole thing i spent days on this and it was perfect I was like okay November first I go to gym daily never stop and do computer work and eat healthy and I’m no longer the same person and I can become sensitive now because I’m a new person and blah blah. Then 31st October I was taken home. Worrrrst thing ever like because I became sensitive and then it was the most painful car ride I mean I was seriously tweaking. But anyways bro. Months and months of like trying to get a perfect moment again, but not about improvement but just about accepting what happened and leaving this stupid in between state. It’s been like 4 fucking months and every time, something happens. I’ve been taking it more extreme recently and haven’t showered or brushed, because like oh my mom and dad interrupted me last time and I was trying to like erase that and act as tho it never happened so I wash hands for hours but idk. Anywyas. Today was the day. I wore the perfect underwear perfect shirt perfect shorts that I was SO FUCKING CAUTIOUS TO WEAR BECAUSE I COULDNT WEAR IT ON AN IMPERFECT DAY, and imperfect is pretty much just a day that my parents have any influence over because I can’t let my moment and shit have influence from them. And it was perrrrrfeft. I set alarm like 5 times to get the PERFECT wake up and set up my room perfectly the bottles on the floor the clothes and blanket everything perrrfect spent the whole week well really 3 months but my mom changed it a little prolly cause it doesn’t seem important to me but it is, a week ago so I spent the week on it too, and ugh. Today things were sooooo perfect and loserlike and perfect that I missed the bus. I went to the other stop, but I went there for the first time the day after she did my laundry and kicked the bottles of water, and I stayed up all night cause of that but anyways, because of that, if I went I wouldn’t think hmm this is new, which in turn is allowing my mom doing my laundry of the 3 shirts and 2 shorts I wore, which were like perfect I wore on hood bad days and accumulated good germs on one and just omg it was so perfect and set up like seriously I have been planning that this week be THE WEEK like over weekend then Monday and bam no longer ocd and shi, cause like I have to time it with parents houses so like I have to plan 3 weeks ahead minimum for real. But anyways I saw some other kid with a backpack and I was like I’ll follow him as to not allow mom doing my laundry that day affect me on my perfect day. Fucking bitch was a random dude smoking at 6am with a backpack and like 5 small animals around him. Not even a student. I ran back to cut losses and make the other one but I missed that too. Called all my like 4 friends/people I know with cars and ugh no one could drive me and I was literally like hyperventilating on the sidewalk or something and then my mom was texting “tell me if you need me to pick you up” and blah blah. School is useless. All my “classes” are either study hall or basic ass classes that lower my gpa for being standard classes, and you just sleep in anyways cause it’s practically study hall too. The only reason I go is because I have to for my perfect moment. That’s the only reason I’m not depressed.

And now it will be a month, maybe more because if they sign me up for therapy that’s another bad week and weeks come in pairs so it’s another bad/imperfect 2 weeks. My mom pulled over by me since she has my location and made me to get in her car after already ruining my perfect text, conversation, noise and sound/noise I hear from her tv and indirect sound which I spent hours exhaustingly making sure was perfect and loserlike and perfectly okay last night. Same with dad too but I don’t see him today so it’s fine. I hate them and I hate doing this ocd last words bullshit but I have to because last words before my loser moment is so important. But she drove me and we were both like arguing and crying and it ruined my outfit’s perfect germs and energy and memory and ruined the day and therefor the weekends and therefor next week and possibly therefor my life idk and I only have like 4 outfits and this was the only grey and black perfect one and now that it’s ruined I don’t have a perfect outfit and idek what to do because I can’t have a perfect moment.  Anymore. Why am I even in school today or for all of the past week if my moment was ruined like it was all and is currently all for nothing now. I don’t know how to deal with this it will now be like 3 MORE WEEKS without brushing and that’s dangerous. But I can’t allow my first brush on the new toothbrush to be on a day my mom drove me to school, or the week after that. What the fuck am I doing now? But also I don’t even know if I want an answer because then it’s allowing something good to come from something good my mom did which I can’t stand. Help.

How do I not beat myself up or get down/depressed about talking to women and dating?,2,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I tend to be very hard on myself when it comes to dating and talking to women. I have had anxiety and social anxiety my whole life and have had some insecurities about myself growing up and still do. 

Back story: I was very shy in high school and only spoke to my close friends. I never approached any girls. The girl I lost my virginity to my junior year in high school I only spoke to when I took her home from school. I was afraid to talk to her in school. Then, my senior year of high school, I entered into a relationship with a girl that went to a different high school. That lasted 4.5 years until my last semester of college. 

When I got out of college, I was so excited to get out to bars with friends. Little did I know how hard it would be to talk to women being a shy guy. Time went on with no luck from the bars and seeing a few of my friends have luck and taking women home from the bars. Tinder and bumble were also very hard for me. Then Covid hit which made it hard for everyone. 

The last couple years starting in 2021, I have gotten a lot better at talking to women and have been on many dates. Hinge dating app has been better than tinder and bumble. I’ve been with a few more women too. No relationships though. I just still get very down on myself. I feel it really messes with my head when I go on a date or two with a woman I find really attractive and then she friend-zones me. Or when I’m texting them and they just ignore me. Women have so many options and can get a guy whenever they want. Since my last girlfriend, only two of the girls I’ve had sex with I was really attracted to, but they both just didn’t work out for a relationship. The other women I had sex with I was kind of attracted to but more just me wanting to have sex. I’d like to attract girls that I’m really attracted to. And I’d like to say I’m a decent looking guy too. I workout and take care of myself.

I feel like I compare myself to other guys and how many women they have gotten or how attractive of a girl they can get. It’s really bad if me to do this and I need to get out of this bad thinking. A lot of the dating advice on YouTube can be helpful, but some of it is just toxic as it says you have to be this kind of guy with this amount of muscle, money, or blah blah blah. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how to not be so self sabotaging when it comes to dating and talking to women.

Can someone please help me?,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"This is gonna be a long post about the things that are possibly or possibly not wrong with me, so bear with me. I’m 16 years old and a while back I was diagnosed with depression. I’m medicated now but I still have a lot of issues that could be unrelated or related. I don’t know.

A quick content and trigger warning for a myriad of issues. Nothing majorly heavy, just a bunch of small issues adding up. (I wasn’t sure if I should tag this but I’m doing it just in case-)

I’m gonna copy paste a list I’ve compiled at the bottom of this post that names all of the things I’ve found wrong with me over time. I have no idea if some of them have been there since childhood (I say childhood, but I’m still just 16. You know what I mean), because for some reason I don’t remember a large portion of my childhood, but I think some of it may have been present since that time?

I do not feel normal whatsoever. All of the neurotypical people I’ve met are nothing like this. I know this is Reddit so I’m gonna take any comments I get with a grain of salt, but I need help. I do have a counselor, but she has told me that I’m completely normal. She said this was on track for kids my age but I don’t really meet people like this, and when I do, they’re neurodivergent. Please help. I’m desperate. I need to know what’s wrong with me. Is this really all normal? It doesn’t feel like it at all.

Also, I’m well aware some of these things could be completely normal, but I feel as if a lot of these are definitely not.

Please help me. If you think I’m normal, tell me. And if you don’t think I am, can you point me in a direction of what it could be? I used to think I had autism but now I think I have bipolar. Ive got a friend who calls me bipolar as a joke and now I worry he’s right. Maybe I’m just a hypochondriac and this is all in my head. I hope not, because I really feel like something is wrong with me.

I want to say that I don’t think there’s anything inherently “wrong” with neurodivergent people. It’s just the word choice I made because I wasn’t sure what other word I could use to get my point across.

I hope this post was at least somewhat clear and concise, as I’m very scatterbrained at the moment and it’s 1AM as I write this. I apologize if there are any mistakes in my grammar or punctuation.

The list:

1. Talking too much 
2. The opposite, talking a minimal amount. It fluctuates
3. Talking about (and thinking about) things I’m hyperfixated on repetitively 
4. Forgetting about what things I talked about with what people so I repeat it
5. Interrupting. I think this is more just a me problem than a brain problem, but I’m so bad with interrupting and sometimes I don’t even realize it 
6. Fidgety. I feel the need to move a lot 
7. Sensory overload. Everything becomes too loud and too much. Goes hand in hand with breakdowns. Sound is too much, I’m I taking too much info, I’m angry and wanna hurt myself, touch is too much. This is like, detrimental to me and it affects me the most out of anything else on this list.
8. Breakdowns. I freak out over the smallest things. The urge to scream and hurt myself are strong, I panic. This goes hand in hand with the sensory overload sometimes.
9. Hyperfixating on certain things for days to weeks to even years until I find no more interest in it. I never get burnout, just keep thinking about said thing until something else piques my interest.
10. Terrible outbursts of anger. I’ve gotten much better at controlling these, though. I think it was just a puberty thing.
11. I talk before I think of what I’ll say. I’m very impulsive.
12. Fluctuating moods. I can be incredibly outgoing and bubbly one second and then quiet and upset the next and vice versa. Sometimes I’ll have a week or so of pure extroverted-ness and then I’ll have a major depressive crash
13. I change the subject multiple times in a few seconds. It’s mostly over text, but a lot of it is irl, too.
14. Intrusive thoughts (ie: I’m gonna hurt this person, I’m gonna hurt myself, what if someone came in here and shot me, someone is in the house, what if we crashed the car and died right now)
15. I absolutely cannot focus on work while people talk. I’ll start getting anxious and frustrated if this happens. (Also goes hand in hand with overstimulation)
16. Overthinking things I didn’t used to overthink (this has drastically increased and has heavily affected my life) (Ex. I hear a noise that’s weird, I think someone has come in and killed my family. I hear weird sounds outside, I think there is an intruder or I think a bomb is being dropped. Not even fucking joking. I fear nuclear attacks way more than I should.)
17. Horrible panic when left alone in public or when I’m asked to do something out of my comfort zone. I can’t ask strangers questions, I can’t ask for help, I can’t DRIVE. It’s just a crippling anxiety.
18. I either eat too much or way too much or way too little. My appetite fluctuates greatly. I switch between overeating and then limiting myself to a meal a day.
19. Constantly changing sleep schedule. I can sleep just fine for a period of time one night and wake up refreshed, and then the next night I’ll go to bed at the same time and be exhausted. Things like that. 
20. I can’t tell what other people think of me. I can’t read their emotions so I assume they hate me. I’m so terrible at reading emotions-
21. Constant zoning out, and if I don’t get to zone out when I want, I feel really weird and upset
22. Derealization episodes(?) Not very common, but it sucks anyway.
23. I have a hard time communicating how I feel
24. Sometimes I talk way too fast or way too slow
25. I often find myself slurring and tripping over my words
26. Weird coping mechanisms (rocking body, moving my head in rotations, repetitive motions such as popping bones, tapping, or tearing my nails off)
27. I violently hate the texture of certain things. I can’t stop myself from thinking of rubbing my teeth against them and it makes me sick. (Fuzzy things, clothes, seatbelts)
28. I’m so terrible with dates and numbers and such. I also just have a bad memory in general 
29. I don’t understand when a certain thing I’ve said is rude. By the time I realize, its  usually too late. 
30. I have what I can only describe as manic episodes. It’s like a week of pure euphoria where I’m insanely productive and then a depressive crash. I know I already talked about that but I wanted to go more in depth with it.
31. Huge fluctuations of sexual or romantic attraction",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41520,Hot,2023,3,High,0,27,6506,positive,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I cured depression by myself.,0,False,False,True,False,9,False,"I know how depression works. No one really helped me, at least they tried. I was almost completely alone. You know it is really hard to get out of that trap. Once you're depressed you might want to stay depressed. Bad idea. It is really important not to waste your life like that. Think about it, depression can lead to a shorter life.  Been depressed for several years. I remembered when I used to be a little happy last year because I just moved to the United States that time. It all got ruined until I started to get bullied. I was trying my best to be nice. It just got worse. I get lower grades and lost motivation. I had interest in science. I had a gf but we stopped talking and it got me worse. Today we are talking now. But the thing is, it doesn't matter if you have gf or not. If you don't you might be more depressed. Don't. You will have a good one eventually if you are happier.

Now, how did I cure my own depression? I remembered today how much fun I had when I was doing things. I realized I could have been way more prepared or successful for my future. Depression does nothing but consume you. It isn't good. It is there to ruin your life. Now you might be questioning your existence. If you exist, it's for a good reason. There is too many chances that you could not exist, why waste that chance, you can live once. God loves you. If you don't believe in God, you should. He will forgive you and guide you. I recommend going to Church every Sunday so you can learn. Why not give it a chance if there is nothing else left. Just get out of depression. If you can't, it doesn't mean that you are weak, it means you really need to try harder. Do absolutely anything possible to get out of it. It's nothing but a trap. Get motivated!! Look for a better future NOW before it's too late. I believe in all of you. 

If you have no idea what your future should be, there are many things to get inspired. I listened to Monstercat Instinct vol 3 which made me motivated to do things. There is a website called Artstation that has pretty cool art. Don't ruin it all by thinking you are never going to be that good or I can't do this. It takes time.

Please delete if not allowed =)

This may not apply to many folks on here, but figured I’d give it a shot anyway. I am looking to recruit participants to complete my online research study to support my dissertation in Clinical Psychology. My research explores the concept of Fear of Depression Recurrence, which captures fears that people who are no longer depressed may have about their depression returning. The goal of this online study is to gain a better understanding of this concept and use that data to validate a new questionnaire designed to measure Fears of Depression Recurrence. We hope that learning more about fear of depression recurrence may present a small window into understanding depression relapse and thus lead to better informed prevention efforts.

**Interested? Here is some more information about the study:**

***Were you ever diagnosed with depression? Do you feel better now?***

The ***Stress and Developmental Psychopathology Laboratory*** at Concordia University is currently recruiting English-speaking participants for a study investigating the potential fears that people who are no longer depressed may have about their depression returning. This study has received ethical approval (REB#: 30017766) and involves completing online questionnaires that assess the fears you may have about your depression returning, as well as the severity, frequency, content, and triggers of these fears. It will also ask you for basic personal information (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, occupation) and questions about your current depressive symptoms, other mental health concerns, beliefs about depression, coping strategies, and quality of life.

The online survey will take approximately **1 hour** to complete. All components of this study can be completed remotely, in the comfort of your own home. Participants who are eligible and complete our online survey will be entered in a draw to win one of **seven** $100 CAD Amazon Gift cards.

**If you are interested and you:**

✔   Are above the age of 18

✔   Have previously been diagnosed with depression

✔   Have no significant symptoms of depression during the last 2 months

"How I was destroyed by war, recounting of a Russian veteran in Ukraine. ",13,False,False,True,False,13,False,"As a Russian conscript who has made it back home, the weight of my experiences on the battlefield still bears down on me. The relentless brutality of war has etched memories into my mind that refuse to fade. Each day is a battle against the ghosts of the past, haunted by the sights, sounds, and smells of combat.

PTSD is my constant companion, a shadow that lurks in the darkest corners of my mind. It manifests in flashbacks that transport me back to the chaos of the battlefield, in nightmares that leave me drenched in sweat and gasping for air. It's the hyper-vigilance that keeps me on edge, the slightest sound triggering a flood of adrenaline and fear.

To those who leave cowardly comments on my Reddit page, know this: your words hold no power over me. I've faced far greater challenges than your feeble attempts to diminish my experiences. While you hide behind your keyboard, I've stared death in the face and lived to tell the tale.

But make no mistake, PTSD is not a badge of honor. It's a relentless torment that no one should have to endure. It's the shattered relationships, the sleepless nights, the overwhelming sense of guilt and shame. It's the invisible wounds that cut deeper than any physical injury.

So before you hurl insults from the safety of your screen, take a moment to consider the reality of war and its lasting impact. Instead of mocking those who have sacrificed so much, show some semblance of humanity and compassion. Because while your words may not bother me, they reveal far more about your character than mine.

Silhouette:

In the dimly lit trench, amidst the suffocating stench of mud and decay, I crouched low, my heart pounding in my chest like a relentless drumbeat. The distant sounds of artillery fire echoed through the earth, a constant reminder of the chaos that surrounded us.

It was a moonless night, the darkness swallowing everything in its path. I strained my eyes, trying to make out any movement in the shadows beyond the tree line in front of me. Suddenly, a rustling sound pierced the silence, and I tensed, my grip tightening on my rifle.

Out of the darkness emerged a figure, clad in camouflage, his silhouette barely visible against the backdrop of the night. Instinct took over as I raised my weapon, my finger trembling on the trigger. In that moment, he was not an enemy, but a threat to my survival.

The crack of gunfire split the air, followed by the sickening thud of a body hitting the ground. Time seemed to stand still as I stared at the lifeless figure before me, his blood staining the earth beneath him. It was a moment of triumph and horror, a stark reminder of the gravity if my situation.

But as the adrenaline faded, the reality of what I had done began to sink in. The weight of his lifeless gaze bore into my soul, accusing me of the ultimate betrayal. Guilt and remorse clawed at my conscience, threatening to consume me from within.

In the days that followed, the memory of that fateful night haunted my every waking moment. The faces of the fallen soldier haunted my dreams, their accusing whispers echoing in the depths of my mind. A relentless torment that refused to release its grip.


Ivan: 

In the darkness of the tree line, amidst the tangled branches and whispering leaves, my friend Ivan lay cradled in my arms, his life slipping away with each shallow breath. The distant rumble of artillery fire provided a haunting soundtrack to our final moments together, a grim reminder of the war that raged around us.

Ivan's face was pale, his eyes glassy and unfocused as he gazed up at me with a mixture of pain and resignation. Blood seeped from the wound in his chest, staining his uniform crimson and pooling beneath him on the forest floor. I tried to stem the flow with trembling hands, but it was futile. The damage was too great, and time was running out.

Desperation clawed at my throat as I searched for words of comfort, but none came. How could I offer solace in the face of such senseless tragedy? Ivan was not just a comrade, but a friend, a brother-in-arms whose laughter had once filled the quiet moments between battles.

As I watched the light fade from Ivan's eyes, a profound sense of loss washed over me, threatening to engulf me in its depths. We had shared so much – hopes, dreams, fears – but now all that remained were memories, fragile and fleeting like smoke in the wind.

In his final moments, Ivan reached out a trembling hand, grasping mine with surprising strength. His lips parted, as if struggling to form words that would never come. But in that silent exchange, we said more than words ever could – a bond forged in the crucible of war, unbreakable and eternal.

And so, as Ivan slipped away into the embrace of oblivion, I held him close, whispering words of farewell into the darkness. His sacrifice would not be forgotten, his memory etched forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved him. In the end, all that remained was the echo of his laughter, fading into the stillness of the night.

The BMP:

The BMP rattled along the rugged terrain, the sound of its engine drowned out by the constant rumble of artillery in the distance. I sat inside, gripping my rifle tightly, my senses on high alert.

Without warning, a deafening explosion shook the vehicle, throwing me off balance. Smoke filled the air as flames engulfed the BMP, forcing me to act fast. I unbuckled my harness and scrambled out of the wreckage, my heart pounding in my chest.

As I sprinted towards the nearest trench for cover, bullets whizzed past me, kicking up dirt and debris. I dove into the trench just in time, seeking refuge from the chaos around me.

Moments later, I heard footsteps approaching. Adrenaline surged through me as I readied my rifle, preparing for a fight. An enemy soldier emerged from the smoke, his weapon raised and his eyes locked on me with deadly intent.

We exchanged gunfire, the sound of bullets whizzing past my head filling me with a sense of urgency. Each shot brought us closer to death, but neither of us was willing to back down.

In the end, it came down to quick reflexes and sheer determination. With a final burst of adrenaline, I took down the enemy soldier, his lifeless body slumping to the ground.

As the dust settled and the echoes of battle faded away, I emerged from the trench, shaken but alive. It was a brutal reminder of the harsh realities of war, where survival often came down to split-second decisions and sheer luck.

I’m a 25 year old male from Australia, I had a fairly traumatic childhood and have smoked cannabis on and off between the ages of 13-24 


August the 14th 2022 was just a normal day, I woke up early, had a coffee, while I checked social media, planned the day & got into some activewear. I then had high caffeinated pre-workout, did a workout and then walked my dog, after that I had my post workout meal and went into my room to smoke bongs of very strong cannabis as all of that had been my morning routine for quite a while, I was also vaping nicotine vapes flat out throughout the day also

I pretty much just did a few things around the house, then got ready to go to work managing a hospitality store for the night. I got home at about 9pm, had a shower, chopped up some weed to smoke & put a movie on. I realised I had a couple canisters of nitrous oxide under my bed that my girlfriend brought over, so I decided to just have a little bit (I never did this really, so just letting everybody know that this was a very rare occurrence) I kept smoking weed after I did the nitrous oxide, and for the rest of the evening everything felt pretty normal just super stoned as usual

Before I deleted it, I used go check it everytime and chat on servers and it distracted me.. Anybody has any advice for me?

Moments there are still, though I'm much improved, I must admit. It can be oddly hard to admit that, I think, as if some gremlin apologist for depression sits upon your shoulder convincing you that you're just as poorly off as before, that you're just as under threat. I full expect a return to bad times, if only to protect myself from disappointment (something you don't need more of when re-stricken with depression), but for a couple months now, I've been able to breathe alright. 

I don't post this to brag, but I recall appreciating such posts when I was rotting in those abominable depths. So, um, like said posts, many ended with something encouraging and/or uplifting, so, er, here's my attempt at that:

Your soul isn't gone, you just need to work on [object permanence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence). What you know to be true (i.e. that you'll never feel anything other than what you do now) is not true. Pride, stubbornness, desire for continuing emotional self-validation, or denial out of blind self-defense against that actuality must be recognized as such put in its proper place of reality-irrelevant compulsions. How you feel now is temporal.

Determining reality with your own faculties is one of the few possessions people really have, which is why it's so hard for them to give it up in the face of depression, when you have so little of yourself already. But understand this: you are not to be trusted right now. The state of your brain renders you unfit to judge the true implications of your present condition. Any conclusion derived and held fast to about the bleakness of your future should be regarded as dismissively as a medieval doomsayer, slicked in filth, ranting in his tattered robes about end times and repentance.

Knowing how I'd've read the above two paragraphs, I realize how little I may be able to convince any of you. Ever messages contrary to roaring horror whilst in depression's throes are met with incredulity, with, ""Yes, yes, but this does not apply to me. My suffering is special."" It is not, and lending further undue credence to the arguments presented in the court of your mind -- which are rigged against depression's opposition anyway -- is a product of being brainwashed by your sorrow and keening misery.

Hello! I'm a student at the University of Oxford. As well as having Generalised Anxiety Disorder myself, I also research anxiety and how our interpretation of body signals might exacerbate it. We are seeking participants to take part in a study on how our ability to detect our heart rate affects mental health. This study involves answering around 1 hours worth of questionnaires. The questionnaires will cover topics such as your mental health, how much attention you pay to signals in your body, how accurate you are at recognising these signals, how negative those signals feel for you, how well you can describe your emotions, and your gender and age.
  

  
We are hoping this study will inform us about how to develop improved therapies for those with eating disorders and anxiety.
  

  
To take part in this study, you should be aged 18 or over and speak English fluently. There will be a short screening questionnaire to make sure you meet these criteria.
  

  
All participants will be in with the chance of winning £25 (converted into your currency) in Amazon vouchers. We are hoping to recruit around 400 participants, and there are 10 vouchers available.

My words of advice, find a hobby you can do alone, but also with others. I enjoy fishing. Don't trap yourself in your room, fuck what others may think, i travel alone, go to movies alone, skip the 3 hour lines at the restaurant and head straight for the bar, and attend sporting events alone.

Fuck that, that is how you end up in abusive relationships, or become depressed by the constant 'failure'. It is like the Jesus freaks that think they can pray away gay or any other thought.

TW - I might be an abuser and I don't really know how to move forward,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello wonderful people,

I (22M) have a rather deep and sensitive topic to talk about, and there's a lot of things I want to be fully honest about to this community to get everyone's thoughts and advice for how to proceed forward. I understand that others will hold me accountable for what I've done, and I am fully prepared and willing to hear everyone out, no matter what it is that is on your minds. 

I've been conscious for years now that I might be an emotional abuser. I have habits of being manipulative, ignoring others' needs, not respecting boundaries as I should, and being extremely narcissistic at times. This feeling of being abusive has led me to cut off with several online friends over the last couple years that I was really close with, because I did not want to affect them even more than I already believed that I have, despite their insistence that I had not, especially my minor friends. 

I've been in a spiral since then where I've joined various online communities to talk to new people, despite the fact I know that I might be abusive, which was very much selfish on my part; I wanted people to talk to, and not to feel the ""void"" associated with what I believe myself to be. Because of that, I definitely feel that I've manipulated and emotionally abused some of my previous online friends, and there was a spiral of going through communities, cutting off with people because I believed that I abused them, then moving to other communities to find people to talk to to pass the time. To tell you the truth, I've looked inside myself, and I truly don't think that I cared about these people as much as I should have, as much as they deserved, despite the kindness that I was shown by plenty of them. I feel horrible for it.

To move on to a recent event, I created a group chat in a certain niche community over the summer due to boredom. I go to college, but felt all but excluded by classmates, leading me to resent others and easily get frustrated; I do not know if this has anything to do with my behavior, or if it is other reasons, because it is hard for me to place when I am ""acting up"" at times. I created that group chat to fill that void, but as usual, I talked almost fully and exclusively about myself, things that I was dealing with and issues that I had, barely asking other people about themselves, which was quite selfish, and I am now fully internalizing that now. It got to the point that I would subtly put other people's problems down to focus back on myself. 

One of the other things that I did was constantly talk about a girl I went to class with who I had a crush on, who I really had wanted to be with. I did not talk s\*xually about her, to my knowledge (I have compulsive memories at times (related to my OCD), so it is difficult to know what is true and what is false). But I was rather obsessive about my feelings, in the sense that I would constantly talk about how I was angry at other guys in my class for being closer with her than I was (particularly one guy who I got worried about), the fact that I considered myself extremely under her league, and just frustrated in general that it likely was not going to work out, because I could tell later on that my feelings were one-sided. I would constantly ask for advice, and I understand in retrospect that this was extremely intrusive into her personal life, if anything, to talk about her to random people online all the time that she didn't know; in general, I was very toxic about my feelings. 

Eventually, I sensed the energy of my ""friend group"" was off towards me, and I went into a phase (partially stemmed by my anger, partially stemmed by my intrusive false memories), where I genuinely convinced myself I was abusing the whole group, including things like being s\*xually abusive, and I was constantly checking my memory to go through the story in my head to prove to myself if I was or not. I accused myself of being an abuser and a bunch of things, partially because of the false memories and partially because I wanted to see myself be ""punished"" for things. Others reacted exactly as you'd expect, sharing my messages in their group chats about me being problematic, and one of them unblocked me to comment on a post that I had written about males that face abuse that I am attacking myself from that post, and that I ""preyed on this random girl from my college."" To elaborate more on things, I did talk to this girl to try to hint at my feelings but I never made any crude jokes or harassed her (to my knowledge), or anything of the sort, in fact I don't think she ever even knew. Although take this with a grain of salt, because I am not a self-aware person whatsoever, and I may not be recalling specific things. 

I called myself out first for my behavior before anyone else did, but it has been implied that I am a r@pist/pr@dator for having those strong unrequited feelings for someone who did not like me back, and everything that happened. So I'm questioning my own mind because of that; I don't know who to explain this to, and I genuinely don't know if I crossed a permanent line from doing that. I've fully accepted the fact that I believe that I deserve to experience consequences/punishment from other people, and that my fate should not be in my own hands; other people should be able to do exactly what they want to me for what I have done. One of my online friends has persistently defended me since it has happened, saying ""you can't even call a CELEBRITY hot, you CLEARLY DIDN'T s\*xually abuse/harass anyone,"" and that's true; I've set boundaries when it comes to talking about NSFW topics in online friend circles because some of my online friends are younger, and I want to ensure that they are protected. 

Since all this happened, I joined another online group, and in this community, I've felt genuinely welcomed and appreciated by everyone, and a genuine sense of affection that others have for me. Because of how they view me, I feel very strongly about trying to be a good person in order to deserve that appreciation, because their feelings matter strongly to me, and I want to fully embody the person that they think I am. I've been extremely unsure how to proceed forward, as I wonder whether I deserve to die; I spoke to a crisis counselor on the phone about this today, and the counselor, as kind as he was, did not seem to understand that I genuinely have inflicted emotional harm or done things that could inflict emotional harm on others, and interpreted things as me being genuinely confused. 

So, that's why I'm here: I genuinely need to get this off my chest, even though none of you have been affected by me, and be held accountable. In conclusion, is there any coming back from the things I have said/done involving my crush and how I have treated others, how should I hold myself accountable and how should I make amends, and is there any way that you believe that I will be able to become the good friend/person that I truly want to be, despite all of my personality issues and emotional abuse I have inflicted?",False,False,mentalillness,149340,Hot,2024,2,Low,0,69,7080,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I have been rejected more times than I can count.

Occasionally, I'll make it to the interview phase, though there's a catch. I don't think I've had an interview last longer than five minutes.

I become meek, stiff as a statue, awkward, tense, and noticeably uncomfortable. The pitch of my voice ascends by three octaves.

At other interviews, I could tell they were trying to be polite and cordial while desperate to end the session. After three minutes. I rehearsed all those answers for nothing. Cause they never even get to the point where they'll ask me the questions.

When i advised her that she and her friend might need therapy because she claimed her “friend” is going crazy, she told me that that the hospital wouldn’t accept them both because they’d think she has schizophrenia or something. This was her words. Also for the record she doesn’t know i know. Also, using her alter persona / imaginary friend’s account (the imaginary 86 year old man) she frequently mentions thinking about suicide. When a person from the distance server found out that she was just pretending about the existence of the old man she told him to either treat her and the imaginary friend as different people or never talk to her again. Should i confront her about this?

No motivation to live and no self love,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I feel like I have no urgency to have a life. Work sounds like a horrendous, repetitive cycle. I look at myself in the mirror and can’t recognize myself. I don’t know who I am and I don’t know if I ever will. 

A person I love greatly recently implied some things behind my back that really impacted me personally after I had told them some shitty things that had happen to me very recently. I have felt like people could care less about my issues as if they haven’t been continuous and life altering.

My grandma recently killed herself, when I had just lost my other grandma a few months back. My mom relapsed (alcoholic) after being sober for 6 months, and brought her terrible excuse of a boyfriend over from another state after he was the reason she relapsed in her past. And to add to everything, I had someone I loved, drove everywhere, bought things for and supported emotionally begin to talk about my flaws and insecurities after I had told her everything. Being fully aware that I despised my attributes and appearance deeply, adding fire to the flame but also not telling me to my face and rather to my other friends. I don’t feel like I have a support system that is reliable, I have begged for a form of therapy and medication but haven’t had any luck. Future is looking bleak. I don’t know what’s next and I don’t know if I want to. The only thing keeping me going is my few friends that as far as I know haven’t been backstabbing, and my little siblings.

I’ve been trying so hard to push it away but it claws at me, always beckoning me to go through with it.

hi! sorry if this isn't the right place to post this but the other day i had a horrible panic attack - and ive never had anything like it. i was just taking a shower and my chest got tight and i opened the window since i thought it was because the water was hot. that didn't work so i knew something was wrong and stepped out when i started getting intensely dizzy. i almost completely fell over and had to call my dad to drag me into my bed so i could lie down. 

what happened then is what i can only describe of quickly going totally blind, and then blacking out/fainting for what my dad said was 3 minutes. he said i fell off the bed, he waved his hand in front of my face to see if my eyes followed it (they didn't), but i was entirely conscious during it according to him. i do not remember much as it felt like maybe 30 seconds to me until i regained my vision and could see my surroundings. he called 911 but i was sitting up and talking fine by the time he reached them so the paramedics didn't come

anyways. i went to the urgent care my mom works at after this and they said i had a panic attack. ive had them before , but NEVER to this degree? all my vitals, blood work, etc... were completely fine but im still doubtful.

How do I [40 M] stop lying to my wife [33 F]?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Recently, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/uOzjtxHoZm) asking how to stop being angry at my wife.  Now I recognize that I am lying, but I don't know how to stop it.  I don't know I am lying when I am lying, it's like I am lying to myslef.  What besides counselling can I do?


Previously I said I was 38 and she was 31, that's because it was written from the perspective of when the great majority of the events happened.  This post is written based on the present time.


I have written this post several times, and I have to keep re-writing it, here is what is happening:


Step 1: 
Write the whole post of what I remember to be true, as truthfully as I can, reviewing it as I write it and confirm it is true to the best of my recollection.


Step 2:
After completely writing the post, re-read it; realize that it is a complete fiction, full of lies.


Step 3
Recognise all the lies that I wrote that I was sure were truths when I wrote them, make note of them.  My eyes try to close, like a dog showing shame, and I get a dull ache at the top of my skull.  Decide that I will correct all the lies.  Return to Step 1.


I believe my mother (far, far political left and  climate change is the harbinger of doom of the end times, we are all going to die bleeding heart liberal) has a a victim complex and I always say that whenever my dad (far, far political right and preys on the weak and naive for profit, believes anything anyone says that is in line with his values, and has a unhealthy firearm addiction) is speaking, he is lying.  I've spent my life trying to be the opposite of my dad, and recently have been working on editing out the programmed behaviours of my mom; I didn't know what they were, but my brain showed me by getting me to the point where I posted on Reddit and all the comments were so hateful to my wife, the light of my life and the best thing that has ever happened to me, that I was disagreeing with everyone, everyone else was flabbergasted, and at the end of responding to the comments I said that I was done with lying and I wasn't going to do it anymore. My brain took that and ran with it and the truth that I am problem and I am lying became apparent to me.


I have noted that the longer a statement gets, the more I turn it into a lie without knowing it.


Some things I am noting:


Need for control and attention:

I feel like I am the smartest person, my first gut reaction is always right, and my opinion is the only opinion that should be listened to, so everyone should just listen to me and no one else should talk.  I want all the attention and all the control and I am aware that when discussing things, if I am not getting my way, I tell what seems at the time to be small lies.


Victim complex and entitlement:

I am the one who is earning all the money and fixing all the problems.  When I am speaking, people shouldn't interrupt me; and when they do, I get very upset.  Because they are victimizing me and no one will watch out for my needs, any actions I take are justified and I am in the moral right.


Here is a more condensed, more accurate retelling of the post I recently made:


My wife talked to me about starting a following for OF and eventually creating an account; I continually, knowingly lied each time because I didn't want to be the one to say no and shatter her personality, instead I knowingly hamstrung her efforts and set traps so she would fail and I would be the victim.


After our wedding, she got told no too many times by too many people and her personality shattered.  She got some counciling and the remains of the shattered intergenerational trauma personality were discarded; she's now working each day to be the person she wants to be, not the person she was programmed to be.


Later I wasn't afraid of shattering her personality, so when OF came up again, I stopped lying and she immediately cut contact with her following and dropped the idea.


TL;DR:


(the lie I wrote at the beginning) whenever I am asked to tell the truth, I say 90% and hold back the 10% that would hurt my wife, due to how her reactions make me feel.  It's beginning to make me feel resentful towards her because either I tell her the truth, and I expect her to have an emotional explosion (I have started recording reality, she doesn't do this anymore); or I don't tell her the truth to avoid the perceived explosion and then I grow bitter and resentful.


(The truth) I want to get my way and I will do anything to get it.  I will agree to anything and then not work in good faith, then lie to myself and especially my wife to get my way.  Even when I think I am telling the truth, I am probably lying.  How do I stop lying when I don't recognize it and I think in that moment that I am telling the truth?",False,False,mentalillness,149340,Hot,2024,2,Very high,0,45,4797,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0
Nurse with social anxiety ,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"My whole life I’ve had really bad social anxiety and when I was little my anxiety was so bad that I had selective mutism. I have always struggled with talking to people and all throughout elementary, middle, and high school I was known as the quiet girl and people would always ask me why I didn’t talk or why I was so quiet. Then in 10th or 11th grade I finally went on Zoloft and it honestly changed my life. Although I still have anxiety and will always have some level of social anxiety and generalized anxiety, being on Zoloft has made it way more bearable. Instead of giving one word answers when people try and talk to me, I am able to force myself to say more and somewhat keep the conversation going. I have been on 200 mg of Zoloft for a really long time now and I can’t imagine going off it. I tried to wean myself off it recently to see how I would do without it and once I was on 150 mg for a month, I could feel my anxiety getting worse so I went back to 200 mg. 

That’s just a little backstory but why I really wanted to make this post is because I am currently so nervous. I just recently graduated college and got a degree in nursing. I still am not sure why I chose a profession where I have to be social all the time and I am so worried that I won’t seem confident enough and my coworkers and patients will think I’m stupid. Even though Zoloft has made my social anxiety far better than it used to be, I still have it and although I can fake conversations better now, I am still bad at it. I am going to be an oncology nurse and I’m so worried about having to comfort patients because I am very bad at comforting people and never know what to say. I’m also really worried because I can be a pretty sensitive person when people are rude to me for no reason and sadly that seems to be a common occurrence with nursing. Nurses can be so mean to each other and I’m worried I’ll get bullied for being so dumb and not confident. My job starts in 4 days and I keep mentally preparing myself for bullying. I feel like the more I expect it to happen, I won't be as surprised when it happens and I won't cry. This is definitely a worst case scenario but I just want to be prepared and hopefully I will be able to have the courage to stand up for myself. Is anyone else here a nurse with social anxiety?

Silent panic attacks? Advice?,2,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Potential trigger warning! (mention of feeling ill/sick)

Hello everyone!

I (21f) started having some concerns over the past week or two. Let me start with some background. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since I was 14. When I was younger I used to have a lot physically visible panic attacks, the hyperventilating, crying, shaking. It was mainly focused around socializing, I would have a lot of panic attacks in school, or before, and lie to stay home and missed a lot of days because of that. 

Through the years, I started going to therapy and getting professional help which helped a lot with that! I also got a job in food service which worked as a kind of exposure therapy and my social anxiety had almost completely disappeared, I rarely got anxious around strangers or being in social settings, only occasionally having the feeling of “I need to leave right now.” I was really proud of myself for working so hard for that, and honestly felt pretty great!

In 2022, my aunt passed away from cancer, which was my first experience with that, and I believe I started to develop pretty severe health anxiety after watching her go through everything. Over the past 2 years I’ve convinced myself I have a lot of things wrong with me even though doctors have no concerns with my bloodwork or anything else. I still overanalyze my body for a lot of things and I’ll have these really hard weeks throughout the year where I’ll convince myself I have some new disease or ailment, freak out and hyper focus on it for 2 weeks or so. And after annoying my whole family and friends with asking them for their opinion, not to mention the HOURS scrolling through google or reddit reading the symptoms of said things I’m worried about, I’ll finally relax and be good for a little while. It’s honestly really exhausting. 

I started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago to have some medicine prescribed to me because I had some in the past that I felt was beneficial to me. I also had concerns over ADHD, which I was also diagnosed with. I was prescribed Wellbutrin to start, and I’m currently taking 300mg daily. More recently I was prescribed Strattera, 40mg a day. I started the Strattera and felt okay at first. The first day I felt REALLY wired and buzzed. The next few days it got better, but then about a week into it I started to feel really nauseous. Like for an entire 4 days I felt like I was going to throw up at any second but I never would. It started to get so bad I couldn’t move and was affecting my ability to work or do anything, so I stopped taking it. A day or two later, I started to have diarrhea real bad and everything I ate went right through me, so my conclusion was I just had a stomach bug, and that’s why I was nauseous. Once I felt better and that I was healthy again, I started the Strattera again, but got that really bad nausea back, and I messaged my psychiatrist about it and she suggested I stop taking it for now if it was making me ill. 

Back to the main point, I recently started struggling with what I believe is silent panic attacks? These are new to me, as I mentioned before, I always dealt with physical panic attacks, however, this feels the same but different. I feel like I’m shaking internally (if that makes sense?), I’ve been getting really nauseous, and just this sort of numb feeling in my whole body? I also feel like my heart is beating fast but the highest I’ve seen it get to is like 85bpm resting. With the health anxiety I have, it’s been freaking me out, thinking that I have diabetes and have low blood sugar, or that something else is happening. I just feel like I have this impending sense of doom or something major is happening. The feeling comes out of almost nowhere, and can last between 30 minutes - a few hours. Eventually though I do go back to feeling normal. I’m also kind of lost because now I don’t know if the medicine was really making me sick or if it was just anxiety? I’m just all over the place right now.

I also don’t know where these feelings are coming from. I’m never actively feeling worried about anything when these attacks happen? I also know sometimes it can be random though, I’ve just never experienced it like that, I always had something stressful happening to cause me to have panic attacks. The only thing recently is I had a falling out with friends, but even then I didn’t consider the friendship healthy and felt much happier when we parted ways. 

Does anyone else experience these attacks, if that’s what it is? If so, how do you deal with it? I tried explaining it to my fiancé, but he never had this feeling so it’s hard for him to fully help me, you know? And should I try the Strattera again? I really want to give it an honest try because I think in the long run it will help me, I just don’t know/can’t tell if it’s the anxiety or the meds making me nauseous? I will talk to my psychiatrist about this when I see her in 2 weeks, but I just wanted an opinion on what you would do?

TLDR; I think I’ve been having silent panic attacks, and I can’t tell if it’s that, or new meds making me nauseous. If you also experience silent panic attacks, what helps you calm down?

My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,2416,True,False,True,False,85,False,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

"I learned to dream big, but it was realism that got me results",3,False,False,True,False,0,False,"We're always told to dream big, to reach for the stars. I bought into that idea wholeheartedly, filling my head with grand visions. But here's the thing: while dreaming big is inspiring, it is a shift to realistic goals that help us keep progressing and being happy. Unrealistic goals are just daydreams that set us up for disappointment.

This approach of setting realistic goals turned my life around & hope it can help you too. Here's what I did:

1️⃣ **Breaking down grandiose goals:** I started small, creating daily tasks from weekly objectives, which stemmed from larger milestones. Sunsama became my go-to tool for organizing these.

2️⃣ **The WOOP method:** It made me proactive rather than reactive. Visualize your goal (Wish), imagine the positive outcome (Outcome), identify potential problems (Obstacle), and make a specific plan to overcome these obstacles (Plan).

3️⃣ **Reflecting on past attempts:** This approach of adaptive learning helps in evolving your goals based on past experiences. Understanding what didn't work in the past guided me in making more informed decisions. I keep a daily reflection journal in the daily planning app (Sunsama).

4️⃣ **Embracing the OKR framework:** This method encouraged me to set ambitious objectives but ground them with realistic, measurable steps (Key Results), ensuring my goals are achievable.

5️⃣ **Adopting the SMART method:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals became my new north star.

Do you have a goal right now that feels more like a fantasy? How can you pivot to make it more achievable?

a big difference between npd (narcissistic personality disorder) and bpd (borderline personality disorder) is that we externalize our truama differently.

bpd people are sad at the world and feel like they have to prove themselves by putting everyone above themselves, handing out so much of their energy & love unconditionally just to feel the intimacy they desire. (their actions are actually pushing people away)


that’s why they end up together a lot because they feed each others conditions. bpd people give npd people the power and attention they crave. and npd people feed bpd people’s cycle to give someone their all and feel rejected.

Now, with me, ashlyn, and my other friend, our relationship was like a friend triangle, we were like the 3 musketeers. We hung out all the time at school, and we got to know each other pretty well. Also, Ashlyn could draw as well, and had a great sense of humor. Just being around her put a smile on my face. I remember, she drew my favorite Pokémon, furret for me one time! That was awesome! Then one day, Covid started. We didn’t think we would have to leave school, but after a couple days where we didn’t have school but we thought we would go back the next day, we were doing online classes. My other friend was there, so was I, but Ashlyn was nowhere to be seen. I eventually learned from my other friend that Ashlyn’s parents divorced, and she blamed my other friend for it. Ashlyn destroyed all of my other friend’s gifts that ashlyn got from her, and she removed all contact from my other friend. It was a huge breakup. My other friend has stated that “Ashlyn did nothing for me”, but I feel that she did. She brightened up my days, and that’s what I remember her for.

I just really need some support.,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"F(22) 

So I have bpd, anxiety, depression, mood instability and some physical health issues. this causes me to be extremely tired and drained emotionally, socially, and physically, pretty much 24/7. I have been dealing with this my entire life. it’s gotten to a point where I have lost/pushed away all of my support and I am extremely numb. I have zero friends. legitimately none. I enjoy solitude; and i’m proud for standing up to myself and removing the toxic ppl from my life. but now I find myself not only in the deepest and longest  depressive episode i’ve ever felt, but just plain sad. like i’m in constant mourning of my old life. they sucked and they weren’t the best, but I had friends to vent to about my days and everything I was feeling. 

i’m starting cosmetology school tomorrow, and everytime someone asks “ARENT U SOOOOO EXCITED ??!!!!😆😆” I choke back my anger and reply with a “yes.” but the truth is, I feel nothing. if anything, I feel terrified this is another failed attempt at school(i’ve withdrawn from regular university 3 times now). I don’t believe in myself. I physically cannot get excited, and it makes me sad. I realized it’s easy to be excited and eager or even nervous when u have a friend to go through it with u, telling u it will be okay, or laughing about the things that go wrong, or just being there for you. I don’t have that anymore. 

I guess i’m really just asking—ik it’s stupid—if anyone can just help me be happy for myself. even just for tonight. I’m so tired of these emotional mental blocks I have installed, whether from my trauma or the meds i’m on, thwarting any joy or feelings. i’m sad. i’m lonely. i’ve given up on myself mentally. I live in the city and struggle with money, so i’m constantly stressed. it sucks bc I KNOW my condition would improve if I could just make friends, have some support, but i’m really worried I don’t care to anymore. if anyone can cheer me on from across the internet though, I think I might be able to muster up a bit of excitement.

There is no one like this. I am a psychopath...,0,True,False,True,False,26,False,"I don't think I see the world the way others do. The way I perceive reality and always have is a fantasy, some creation in my own mind. My mind is clouded and always changing, erratic and impulsive. It is rare that I can actually write out my thoughts as I am right now. I am more writing this to myself than anyone else. When I am not in control others have always just thought I was weird, A.D.D., random, and I just play it off as such. I live my life in my memories, never in the present. Sometimes I tell people that my past has made me who I am, that things that could have broken me made me stronger. It's complete bullshit. My past has fractured me into an unstable and dysfunctional human being. My entire life revolves around being charming, interesting, funny, sociable, likable, but this persona I've created has cracks and I can't always hold it together. 

The next topic tonight is my obsession with psychopaths and sociopaths in the media. I play videogames for the wrong reasons. It's best to explain that when I was 14 I was completely insane and thought of nothing but murdering a particular individual. I channeled it through watching and delving into the darkness of the fictional serial killer Dexter. I now watch every episode of every season once a year. For the rest of the year, I try to keep my thoughts in healthy places, but as time goes on, I find myself searching for psychological thrillers and anything else with an evil main protagonist. 

I'm also a drug addict. Pot head turned alcoholic turned Adderallic. I've been trying to get sober off adderall which I'm prescribed but I've given up the battle. My thoughts get to dark without it. 

I'm also completely void of emotion. 

I have redeeming qualities. I am like two people. The good side of me you would like, I promise. I want to learn. I want to achieve. Well, I can't really write about the good in me because that's just not where my mind is right now. 

My mind is not one I want to delve into to deeply right now as I have a thousand times before, but suffice to say it is unlike any other. I am like a Nikola Tesla and others know it. I have never met anyone with a mind as unique huge creative and gifted as mine. I know it sounds like ego, but I'm being blunt. 

I try to stay away from psychology. I don't know why I say that. 

My body is always aching but I'm ok with it as long as no one else is around and I don't have to hide it. 

I just can't handle this anymore. If I were to analyze myself from someone else's perspective who saw what was going on inside, I'd say I was very close to the edge of my sanity, not necessarily to hurting other people, because I don't want to do that. I want to cry so badly. I think I want to cry more than I want anything else besides death. 
What does it mean to be someone who can't cry?

Half of what I write is a fucking lie. Likeable? Ha. Maybe. But I don't like other people anymore. I'm not surrounded in glamour. I spend most of my time alone, the only place I want to be. Alone to spiral down. In some way I feel pain. A lot of pain. Scratch that. That's just the feeling of my lungs wanting a cigarette. Though perhaps some emotion is manifested in that. I don't know. 

I've closed off almost every relationship i have. It's like my heart is a clock running out, until it hits zero and is shut. I had closed it off to all but my best friend, which I imagined it was still open to. I hadn't seen or talked to him in months. I just got back from visiting him last weekend. It made me realize that I had shut him out too. There is no one left. and I don't care. 

I almost want to write about my bdsm thoughts but I won't go there. Not tonight. 

I need to die. I have lived a short life and it has been far to long. I need to die. I'm an old man waiting to die alone. Did I really just quote Inception...

Don't bother telling me I need treatment. 

I forgot to mention that I should no longer be around people. I've been having ""outbursts"", ""cracks"", I've been assaulting the kids at school in fits of blind rage. I can't control myself. I need to die or just go away far far away far far far far hmm hmm hmm hmmh mhmm why does the music never fucking stop. Why. IT NEVEr FUCKING STOPS. There is always music in my head always.

TalkingRelief,1,False,False,True,False,1,True,"Well, it's complicated, it's hard for me to even talk about it with my psychologist, my voice breaks and I just can't talk even when I want to. 
I will try to summarize all my trauma, I express myself best by writing and reading. Maybe I can read it for my psychologist. Sorry if there are grammatical errors, English is not my language. 

When I was 7 years old, I had a pretty normal life, or that was until my sister suffered a brain hemorrhage and went to the hospital with my parents while they sent me to different families of friends and acquaintances to take care of me. That wasn't really a problem, I was just a little scared because everyone was reminding me that my sister would probably die, although I still always felt good, I was made to feel welcome by the 3 families I was with and even though my parents didn't see me to take care of my sister, it didn't affect me much. 

But everything changed when they took me to my aunt. My aunt had an argument with my mother before, but I still had a good relationship with my father, so they didn't hesitate to leave me in their care (obviously they asked in advance, it wasn't obligatory) 

My aunt on the first day just put me out on the street with the equivalent of 2 dollars and told me to get by. The first day was glory, I thought that not having adults was the best, but the second day I had no food or money. I went back to my aunt's house who beat me up and left me on the street again

So yes, that was my situation then, I remind you that I was still a 7-year-old girly. I taught other homeless people how to collect cardboard to get money,  I collected cardboard and with that I was able to earn some money and money equaled food. I met a boy a little older than me in the same situation, so I followed him and we became friends, I called him ""big brother"" I don't even remember his real name. We played when we got the food that used to be cookies. Once we played knocking on the doors of houses and running away to see how people react and laugh.

Only he knocked on the wrong door and a guy came out with a gun and started shooting. We ran and went together, until a pam sounded and he fell silent and I just ran like a coward and left him behind. I never saw him again and to this day I wonder if it was the right thing to run, after all I left him alone, maybe dying.

And this was the beginning of my traumas. I was alone again on the streets. They were one of the most dangerous in the city where it was known that there were criminals, being a child, I had to keep my guard, so I didn't sleep. Eventually I managed to get together with a group of homeless people, I think drug addicts that I was fortunate enough to meet. 

They didn't take advantage of me, in fact they were very nice to me, they started playing the games I played with me. The problem was that we were still on the street and had to avoid other more violent groups. I remember once we came to rest at a place and a group told us to leave their territory. One of our own, one of the bravest, said no, but one of the other group also came out, opened his knife and slashed him in the neck. He tried to keep up, but there was a lot of bleeding And he fell to the ground. I remember they covered my eyes and carried me running. But I also remember when I made a pet bottle and It broke, we had a funeral and they did a great job following the game. 

Eventually I got used to it and one day my aunt had the audacity to pick me up, but not to take care of me, obviously, but because I had started school and it would be very suspicious if I didn't go. So he would take me from the street at a certain time to his house, set a timer and I had to be ready to walk to school, and then he would go back to his house, leave my things and drop me off on the street again. 

The kids started making fun of me for my bad smell and appearance in general, also how I fell asleep in class. It broke my heart, before I was loved by those who claimed to be my friends, now they just laughed at me. The ""jokes"" escalated and there was quickly physical abuse after school. There were times when I would limp in. 

I wasn't happy with my aunt or at school, the street was the only refuge. I decided once not to go with my aunt at the allotted time so I wouldn't go to school. In the afternoon, my parents found me, took time to look for me, and scolded me for running away from my aunt's house. I tried to explain that she wasn't good to me, but they just shut me up, they thought they were excuses because I didn't want to be in school. They sent me to my aunt's house and left, I hadn't seen them in 4 months and they only came to scold me. At my aunt's house it didn't go any better, she had an electrical cord with which she hit me. It hit my back so much that it opened it up, I switched to putting my chest on, but it was worse and gave me a terrible cut on my chest (for a mental picture, I still have a visible scar after 10 years). He kept beating me, for a long time until he got tired and threw me out into the street. 

I was able to crawl and eventually stand up, but everything hurt and I couldn't keep it up for long, luckily I made it to my group. I didn't go to school the next day because the injuries prevented me from moving and my aunt didn't want to have a child abuse warning. The only ones who took care of me were them, but I really don't know what hurt me more, the wounds for my aunt or that feeling of betrayal from my own parents. 

And that's how my 6 months in the worst hell went. Eventually I went back to my house, but it wasn't the same anymore. My sister came out alive and without any sequelae other than a slight lost memory and the loss of her great math skills, But my parents put all their concentration on her, and I became invisible to their eyes. My schoolmates were still bastards. I remember when I mentioned that I wanted to be a veterinarian, they took a cat and cut it open by the belly, and then they threw it at me, agonizing saying that it will repair it

I had to learn how to fight, but I only ended up like this alone, I only had 3 friends, I don't know if I could call them that because they were only with me to defend them from the bullies. 

That's how it happened until I was 10. Then they took me to another school and I suffered a mental breakdown. I had learned that I had to fight against everyone because no one was going to help me and that everyone was mostly hostile and didn't care And, when I walked into that classroom, I was given a different reality where they were good for the sake of being good. I didn't understand it 

I had to fight a lot to readapt to this new world where everyone didn't call me weird, but told me that I was very nice to take care of them. 

But even so, all that never went away. It's been 10 years, sometimes I have nightmares, I have a lot of intrusive thoughts, panic attacks and flashbacks that keep haunting me despite everything being okay. I was recently diagnosed with complex PTSD, and I'm relieved to finally know what's wrong with me. 

That's why I'm grateful that there's this kind of community, it's pretty good that people get together to get through this. That's why I thank those who read, I'm probably going to read this too to express everything to my psychologist.",False,False,ptsd,100207,Hot,2024,2,Medium,0,13,7313,neutral,negative,False,False,0,0,0
I feel trapped,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hi. I am dealing with some stuff and I've seen countless doctors and had scans, labs, and therapy. None of that is working so after lurking in this page I've decided to post and see if anyone out there is dealing with the same or something similar or found a ""cure"". Here's some back story, I've dealt with intermittent anxiety in my teen years but for the most part everything was fine in my adult life. I love to be in high stress environments like debates, skydiving, and impulsive reckless things. However, December of '22 I  start to have what we believe were dissociative episodes. It would happen when I was driving or talking to someone and I wouldn't be able to remember what the hell happened during. I naturally go to the ER a doctor (bad one) tells me I might have a tumor, so we do a CT which shows nothing. He says we should do an MRI but I have to schedule elsewhere which doesn't have availability until February. Naturally this makes the episodes worse. I check into a different ER and beg for an MRI. I get one and it shows a 7mm lesion on my pineal gland and wouldn't cause these episodes. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me so I break down, call out of work go to another doctor and sob with my father since I couldn't even trust myself to drive at this point. I get hydroxyzine and life is ok again. Until....my honeymoon. April '23, I'm in Dublin second floor of a souvenir shop, with my amazing husband on facetime with my mom, I throw him the phone because all of a sudden I NEED to get out of there or I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Then I get outside and I'm ok. Things are normal again. Then July comes, husband is visiting me (we live apart as he is active duty air force stationed in England and I am in Minnesota for work) and every day I am in these episodes so I see the doctor from December and get Xanax, doesn't work and eventually makes things worse because I start worrying about the side effects like if it's been long enough since I took it to drive etc... So then I meet with doctor we start Prozac still nothing. I also during this period learn episodes are especially prevalent if I'm eating or drinking alcohol and I feel the anxiety in my throat armpits and chest. Like I'm gonna hurl. I visit my husband in Oct '23 and no episodes except when I had a sip of a martini. We also didn't really leave the house to really trigger any episodes but it was reassuring to know he was not the catalyst. So eventually I give up on this doctor because nothing is working. I start to think I am agoraphobic but I get groceries and run errands and things just fine. I recently in the last two months started seeing a psychiatrist who at first prescribed Lexapro but it made me terribly ill. I switched to Buspar 15 mg twice a day and I thought maybe it was working. Husband came and visited and during the 3 weeks I had a few major episodes and completely skipped dinner with my boss in fear of the embarrassment of not eating etc, didn't eat at Christmas, and wouldn't go out to eat at all. So nothing that could cause the episodes. I feel like my life has been stolen from me. I am truly miserable. I LOVE people, I LOVE to be social but since December of '22 I avoid it like the plague. Last Thursday I got a haircut and it has left residual anxiety until today even. I had a VERY bad episode. And to clarify it's all internal. Most people don't even know it's happening. My breathing is fine, heart rate is fine, but internally my mind is RACING and my legs are week, hands clammy, the works. It feels like someone is pointing a gun at me and I just have to deal with it. I want to enjoy life again. I want to start a family with my husband, I want to want to live life. I am tired of feeling trapped. So my question is has anyone else dealt with this? If so what helped? Has anyone tried Beta Blockers for this?

This is the closest thing I can describe as ""me"" I suppose but I don't always feel like a real person or that I am ""alive"". Oddly enough I can pretty much understand exactly what's going on with me when I'm in this ""mindset"" or whatever you would call it.

2. Crying and feeling angry over rather minor things (example, today my boyfriend didn't want to hang out because he's sick. I shouldn't care but I feel like my heart is ripped out of my chest at the moment and I feel insane. I feel like he doesn't love me, and I feel very irrational). I usually have a panic attack during this as well which makes it more intense. Normally I turn to self sabotage and tend to be more manipulative. I normally don't even realize I'm getting like this until I type something out that's mean or manipulative, and it's only if I catch it before it's too late (which I recently started doing but that's because I've been very down emotionally the past two weeks). This happens at the same time as any immense emotions I feel (normally feeling anxious, sick, or depressed triggers this).

I'm trying to get my life together at the moment and I'm seeing moments of this in my new relationship, and I'm trying to get control of it. My boyfriend's very understanding and loving and I don't want to fuck this up. I feel like this is probably something I've done for a very long time that I'm just realizing. I can remember as a kid saying very manipulative things and losing a lot of friends.

Don't make other people's problems yours if you don't need to. We all have our own problems to deal with, and adding other people's problems on top of that can be a problem in and of itself, leading to distress and anxiety. Try to prioritize your problems and tackle them in that order, one by one. Start with your own problems, because how could you fix someone else's problems if you haven't taken care of your own? Also, only fix problems that you can fix; avoid wasting time and energy on things that are outside your control.

♦️ 10 mental errors that hold people back (and how to avoid them),74,False,False,True,False,3,False,"# 1. Salience Bias

We focus on shiny features and overlook weaknesses.

A Lamborghini is impressive.

Until you find out its insurance and gas costs.

It also happens with people when you are **hiring or** choosing as friends (e.g. high charisma, low integrity).

So always consider *the dark side* of shiny features.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 2. Loss aversion

We feel the pain from losses stronger than the joy from gains.

This causes people to:

* Miss opportunities
* Stick with jobs they hate
* Overvalue what they own (assets, relationships, etc.)

To avoid it, take each decision as a [bet](https://fronterablog.com/thinking-in-bets/).

Losses are normal.

The important thing is making the **best decision** with the available information.

So if the potential gain is much higher than the risk, go for it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gndr38nkt2aa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c7dc86a4de2992f8db5d0a4b0fec824d0765991

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 3. Commitment bias

Our minds desire consistency with our previous actions.

Even when they don’t serve us anymore.

But how much you worked on something doesn’t matter if the project is failing.

So always ask yourself:

*“Would I still do it if I had not told this to anyone before?”*  


https://preview.redd.it/vhtvxvkot2aa1.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a63d48c8527fae93f8764b9d5d4fa51309e9c58b

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 4. Status quo bias

People think *the existing state* is good by default.

Because familiar feels safe.

But it prevents us from looking for a better job, process or product.

So use this question to challenge it:

*“If I continue to say yes to this, what am I saying no to?”*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 5. Association bias

Our minds use associations as shortcuts to building opinions.

Three examples:

* High price = high quality
* An emotional advertisement = positive feelings about a brand
* Business dinner at a luxury restaurant = Positive opinion about a deal

So separate associations from the **facts**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 6. Hindsight bias

Everything feels obvious after we know the outcomes.

And it creates a dangerous illusion that the future is predictable.

So people over-rely on forecasts and make bad decisions.

To avoid it, don't depend on predictions.

Always **prepare** for an unpredictable future.  


https://preview.redd.it/38s7j2att2aa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9f7083ed6fd0e6a15b6073a22a09ce7a1848466

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 7. Recency Bias

Our minds overvalue recent information.

If a stock went down recently, we become pessimistic about its future.

Even when everything is looking good for the long term.

To avoid recency bias, zoom out.

Assess your decision with all available information.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 8. Anchoring Bias

People depend too much on the first piece of information they get.

A real estate agent first shows you a mediocre house — knowing you won’t buy it.

Then they take you to the house that they want to sell.

After the first house, the second feels like “the one.”

And you’d more likely buy it on the spot.

So when the stakes are high, question your starting points. 

And contrary to popular belief, **be the first to mention a price** in negotiations.

The other side will use it as an anchor and adjust from that.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vdu7a8tut2aa1.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b386a66e9102412e2399af4e9b5db601a1335357

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 9. Framing Effect

People react differently to the same decision depending on different frames.

10% death risk from surgery sounds scary.

But a 90% success rate sounds safe.

So take your decisions through the negative frame to assess the real risk.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5430rnext2aa1.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a04148779c8da9b911127fdcd38d76c1d5f0a97e

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 10. Authority Bias

People tend to agree with the opinion of a high-status person.

Regardless of the merit of the argument.

So the “highest paid person’s opinion” usually prevails.

Judge ideas independently to avoid it.

No matter the title, let the best idea win.

But in total since graduating 2 years ago I’ve worked 6 jobs most being at home,

Job 1 was advertised as “marketing” but really I was doing my narc boss is admin and not using any of my skills learnt.

Job 2 the CEO suddenly realised she hates being a CEO and wants to go back to doing s 9-5 so I got laid off.

Job 3 a retail job I picked up while in job 2 because I could tell the CEO was having doubts about the company and specially after loosing a lot of money. 

Job 4 my dream job that I moved to the capital city for but the company was making 0 money my boss that hired me got laid off so eventually so did I.

Job 5 retail again in an industry I like however the pay was far too low to justify spending 5 days there, they never gave me time off so I’d have to call in sick to do interviews last pay was £800 a month.. everyone was leaving my mental health became bad so I had to leave ( had savings for rent)

You're not lazy! You have a fear of success,3,False,False,True,False,5,False,"Tldr, watch my YouTube vid: [https://youtu.be/2XwzmrYWNEg](https://youtu.be/2XwzmrYWNEg)

You *know* what you need to do

Your homework, or go the gym, or write that report

But you don't do it

You're not lazy, you just have a fear of success

Fear of success? There's no such thing

Yeah there is

Success comes with new challenges, responsibilities, and expectations

So your ego tries to self sabotage you by holding you back, because it's scared of these changes

Your ego's like: ""I know who I am!"", ""I want you to stay the same forever!""

Do you want to stay the same forever?

No, you don't

You want to grow, right?

You want to build/break habits

The first step is awareness

Ask yourself: ""If I'm successful with this habit I'm trying to build, how might it change my life? How might it give me new challenges, responsibilities, and expectations?""

Those changes might feel uncomfortable

But don't correlate feeling uncomfortable with it being bad

Growing is uncomfortable, because you're going outside your comfort zone

But that's the only way you grow

When you build muscle in the gym, it hurts right? But your muscles are growing!

Growth is uncomfortable, but that's not bad, it's good

Becuase it means you're getting stronger

You're not lazy, you're just scared of success

I don’t have a lot of friends, I have two male friends that I hold very dear to my heart and my wife is probably overall my best friend. I’m definitely an introvert, but I’m confident and verbally articulate in social situations. My ENTIRE life I have struggled with forming relationships with other men because I believe I threaten their masculinity. It can be really difficult navigating social situations that is predominately men because they have this preconception of me that i am seeking to dominate when in reality, id consider myself more feminine than the average man. I have a huge appreciate for psychology and I’m observant of peoples behavior, making it easy for me to identify men’s insecurities.

My abuser had a second child,74,False,False,True,False,42,False,"I have an ex. He treated me like shit, I won't go into details but it was abusive.

He left me for a woman at work. He quickly got married and had a baby with her. They have a second baby now. I learned this just now via Facebook. I saw a post from his MIL gushing about the babies and how wonderful he is. 

Do I feel something about this? I don't know what I feel. I feel something and I don't like it. 

He got married and had children so quickly with her, but I wasn't good enough. 

Both of his children are girls. How can he be a good father to them, when I know how he treated me? If his daughters ever had a boyfriend like him, would he protect them?

Why is he able to keep this relationship with his wife and children? For their sake I hope he is a changed man, but why wasn't I worth treating right, and they are?

Why does everyone think he's great except me?

If he is ""a good man"" from now on, how am I going to look, when I talk about how badly he hurt me. Crazy, that's how I will look. So I can't. 

We still share a friend network. I can't hang out with them, because I can't predict when someone will mention him, and hearing about him ruins my day. 

I know that hearing about him ruins my day. So why did I check Facebook anyway? Why do I have this morbid curiosity to check up? 

I think maybe I'm hoping to see karma catching up to him. But it never does. Maybe it never will. Maybe he really is a good person now and it will forever be only me who had to endure his shit.

I am in a relationship with a far better man. My boyfriend is amazing. Talented, funny, intelligent, kind, attractive. My ex doesn't compare.

Can you tell the difference between social anxiety vs. genuinely not wanting to socialise?,18,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I can't.

It's like in theory I ""want to want"" to be the type of person with an active social life, I want to enjoy it, but in reality it's a lot of effort and I won't get much enjoyment out of it.

I feel pressured to say yes because this person is reaching out, I don't know how to say no politely, it's ""normal"" to say yes and want to hang out with people, and I ""should"" be trying to overcome SA and practice leaving my comfort zone, etc. This person was nice and interesting and I'm a little curious to find out what they've been up to, but I don't feel a strong interest in friendship or anything with them and I'd rather stay home.

Is the mind really this powerful?,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
Hi everyone,I'm a 24 year old man who lost his dad to cancer in 2013. Not to bore you with the whole story: I've been having OCD and anxiety since I were a little kid. After a traumatic experience that started on April 28th, 2022, I was sure cancer was going to kill me. I felt an immovable hard lump above my collarbone on the right side of my body. An echo showed nothing malignant, but on the 9th of May 2022 I started having a weird pressure on the right side of my head accompanied by a left side weakness of my left leg and left arm.

Went to my GP and she brushed it off as anxiety, because I passed the balance,reflex tests etc. and the weakness wasn't measurable. However, I continued having these symptoms every day 24/7 until today. Went to my GP last week and again she told me: the fact that these symptoms didn't worsen can tell you it's nothing sinister. Even told her I had this weird smell sensations that would come and go since April/May of 2023. Since that visit I fell hard, really hard. I've done a lot of research and I sought a lot of reassurance, but based on my symptoms I can't imagine it being psychosomatic or something. Even with my intense trauma's in the last 10 years. I always thought it would be something that's in my mind since it started after reading about cancer in that stressful period. Last year the symptoms just went more to the background as i didn't give it much attention, but now that my anxiety is high again I can only think about this. My left leg and arm twitches here and there and sometimes i feel spasms when almost falling asleep on that side too. These are all red flags.How is this possible, can I be having a brain tumour for the past 2 years and no one taking me serious? I'm terrified really, what if it was a low grade tumour in 2022 and it's turned malignant now. What if this thing is really inside my brain and is spreading. I have a beautiful fiancee whom I will marry in July and we bought a house that's almost ready. Will I really not be able to see those beautiful things happen? It may sound dramatic, so I'm sorry but for me this feels terrifying and how can all these symptoms be explained in any other way?

I want to ask for a neuro appointment and at the same time I'm terrified to do that. Terrified to have him tell me I have something real bad. At this moment I just don't know what to do and how to handle this. I am even linking my OCD and Anxiety that started 10 years back to something that had already started to grow in my temporal lobe (where I feel the pressure).

My mom, fiancee, sister.. they all have been telling me to trust the doctors and that I should see a therapist instead of a neurologist. What if they're wrong, what if I have something.. How would they feel about this. I don't want to hurt them, I just want to enjoy my life and I'm afraid it will end soon.PS: I never vomited because of the head pressure. It also never wakes me up from sleep and isn't worse in the morning. Constant 3-4/10 pressure that can get worse when exercising or bending over. Always returns normal after standing back up again. Also my right eye twitches the last couple of weeks when i close my eyelids.",False,False,Anxiety,661115,New,2024,2,Very low,0,33,3185,positive,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Self denial of trauma,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"TW: discussion of medical trauma and chronic pain

Hello everyone, so I’ve been recently trying to come to terms with my medical trauma and I’ve had a very difficult time accepting that I’m traumatized. I feel as though my issues are small compared to everyone else.

I suffered from chronic abdominal pain for almost 7 years, starting in middle school. I went to the doctors almost twice a month begging them to look further into what was wrong with me. I was sent to specialists and even Brenner’s children’s hospital and they didn’t even look further than the fact that I was young and a girl. I was told I was either faking it, making myself sick due to anxiety, or it was just my menstrual cycle. 

The pain I went through everyday was debilitating and I started isolating myself and stopped going places because I feared getting sick or being in pain out in public. Everytime I think about the past 7 years I just want to sob and breakdown.

It almost took me going into liver failure before they discovered I had severe gallbladder disease and a blockage in the tube connected to my liver. All I can think about is the entire week I suffered before finally going to the hospital and almost passing out several times due to the pain. 

I know what I feel is real, but I keep denying the trauma I have internally. It’s hard to accept I’m traumatized by the medical system when there’s people out there who have experienced far worse.",False,False,ptsd,100208,New,2024,2,Medium,0,21,1438,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Boyfriend experiencing depression and it's affecting our relationship,2,False,False,True,False,4,False,"I have been dating my boyfriend for about eight months now and up until fairly recently I would say we have a healthy relationship. He expressed to me a few months in the he's experienced depression before and was diagnosed with it in middle school. However he was not experiencing any depressive episodes when we first met or throughout the majority of our relationship so far. 

I too have experience with depression and was diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety a few years ago. I spent about two years in cognitive behavioral therapy to improve my mental health. Recently I noticed a change in my boyfriend's mood and how he seemed not really excited about doing things together as much as he used to or going on dates and suspected he was starting to get into a depressive state. He would say things like how he just wishes he could go away somewhere where no one could find him on multiple occasions and just overall seemed a lot less happy.

He's been having a more stressful time recently due to being six months away from graduating university and worrying about the future. Which I suspect may have triggered this. I have been doing my best to support him and listen to his worries and give him advice, but recently I started to feel like when he spoke about the future he wasn't involving me in his plans which honestly triggered anxiety about the relationship for me.

I called him one night and told him about how I was feeling a lot less emotionally supported and that something was off in the relationship and basically felt he wasn't thinking about his future with me. He told me that wasn't his intention but then asked how I felt about our relationship now.I told him I was still happy being with him but felt we had things we need to work on. He admitted he wasn't 100% happy in the relationship right now and was struggling to feel his emotions and attraction and has been for about a month or so. He said he feels his depression has never felt like this before and at times it feels overwhelming and scary. However, he does not feel ready to seek help right now such as therapy and wants to try to handle it by himself. 

I of course want to support him during this time and help him however I can but felt like he was pushing me away which he admitted he was. Basically he said he doesn't think we can continue the relationship normally because he would feel like he was pretending if we were to go on dates right now. I've been trying to be as understanding as possible and not take what he's saying too personally as I do want to be in this relationship. We ultimately decided to take a break for two weeks to evaluate our feelings and the  relationship. I want to give him the time and space he needs, but worry if by suggesting the break I made the right decision as I didn't want to pressure him too much. 
I still want to show him I love  and support him as I chose to be in a committed relationship with him, through good and bad. But I'm also aware that he's very stubborn about actually doing anything to address what's happening right now even down to not wanting to do research about depression and how it may be affecting him.

I think I'm just looking for some advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation as this is all very recent and I'm wanting to approach things in the right way and still be there for him, but worry that he may already be emotionally checked out from the relationship as he can't feel his feelings/ feel enjoyment or like he's getting anything from the relationship right now.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41518,New,2023,3,Low,0,69,3548,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0

How do you deal with boisterous overhyped people?,9,False,False,True,False,5,False,"Hi folks,
  

  
First off, I have a lot of general and social anxiety.
  

  
I am a quiet person and don't say anything unless I have something to say. That said, I do ensure that I'm offering some sort of reaction like a smile or exclamations during social interactions.
  

  
At work and other social events (like my partner's bday), I come across a type of people who are on the opposite spectrum. They are loud, they talk a lot, very very spontaneous. I usually try and avoid them but sometimes I have to deal with them.
  

  
Some of these people, try to get a reaction from me because I'm quiet and in doing so they put a spotlight on me. They ask awkward questions or even behave aggressively. Some of these behaviors are well-intentioned because I think they feel I'm being left out but I hate the way they deal with me. It triggers my anxiety through the roof. And I end up either having a panic attack or shutting down completely.
  

  
I also think overtalking or being boisterous and overhyped is a way for them to deal with their anxieties.
  

  
In the past, I have tried to match their enthusiasm but it's exhausting and can come across as fake.
  

  
So, I'm wondering what is a good way to deal with such people when you don't have an option to avoid them.
  

  
Some of you are probably going to tell me to deal with my anxiety better. I'm already doing everything I can to manage my anxieties (like meditation, proper sleep, hydration, exercise, and other stuff).",False,False,Anxiety,661114,New,2024,2,High,0,49,1490,neutral,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Yesterday I had some mates around and M was going to be out for the night at his girlfriends. I had invited M three times, he seems alone and I want to make sure he feels welcome. We were all chilling when he came back home in the middle of an anxiety attack and then stood in the living room outside his bedroom just sobbing and hyperventilating while his girlfriend had to tell him to go into his room. 

My friends are gracious and kind but were so uncomfortable. I have serious social anxiety but if my roomie had mates over I wouldn’t step in and ruin the night like that. He did not need to stand there and repeatedly make a scene. It’s making me feel on edge constantly, I can’t imagine how it made my friends feel. They left!

The next morning I tried to bring this up to him in the most gentle way I could. I tried to tell him that it’s hard when our anxiety can affect people. He responded by saying how his girlfriend is so great. He didn’t get it, saying “that’s why I went in my room” - well you didn’t. Today he’s just sat in the communal space like a lost puppy, and it’s hardly making us want to be around him. I have to see his face everytime I leave my bedroom, it makes me not want to leave my room. 

I feel awful on the prospect of having to bring it up again for fear of upsetting him or hurting him, he looks fragile. He told me he’s just worried about his future, which is awful but he’s from a wealthy powerful family with ties to NATO and can’t do the recycling, we all know where he will end up if he carries on like this. How can I try and get to know him if he’s just sat there? I’ve asked him to hang out to go do things and I’ve engaged with his special interests but I’ve just been though some really challenging times and this isn’t helping me feel safe! I just want to come home and not feel like a mother, I don’t want kids!

TL;DR: Roommate M, in his twenties, exhibits strange behavior like walking around in boxers and loud gaming. Shared ground rules were set, but he still seems needy. Invited him to hang out with friends, but he returned with an anxiety attack, making everyone uncomfortable. Tried addressing it gently, but he didn't understand. Now he sits in communal spaces, making the atmosphere uneasy.

Anyone else have a hard time concentrating while reading because of anxiety?,109,False,False,True,False,20,False,My mind thinks anxious thoughts and I can’t focus.,False,False,AnxietyDepression,55678,Top,2019,9,High,0,76,50,negative,negative,False,False,1,0,1
"I don't know if this is anxiety, panic, anger or what",1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Recently I (24M) wasn't feeling that good. I felt like I'm at the verge of collapse and at moments I would start loosing contact with reality (no false beliefs or hallucinations, more like being numbed by intense negativity), but after going on a 'vacation' home for the carnival, I feel more stable. But now despite being stronger mentally, emotionally I feel like I should break apart from this thing I'm feeling, but I'm holding on naturally and just I don't know how to process this or get calm.

I have troubles with my parents, as they divorced after a really disgusting situation (I told them they should've divorced a long time even as a teenager) and now both of them, who live in the same house but different flats try to manipulate me to cause issues for the other one. Both of them try to get on the good terms with me occasionally for like two days in a row, and once they think they got on my good terms they start with their stories, which often include toying with my feelings of weakness, shame, and empathy. My mother (yuck) is an egoist and usually drops the facade when she sees I don't bulge (she's certainly a narcissist), while my father, lacking shame just continues with the bullshit, although he does get aggressive (verbally, but possibly physically) from time to time (he's likely a psychopath). Before this whole bullshit situation between them (a few years ago) I quit contact with my mom, saying that I don't know if she wants me good or harm, but that I want to distance myself, and I felt healthier than ever. It was the only time in my life where I felt like I was developing as a person. I even went on a date! But a few months later I had a student promotion and it felt wrong to not invite my family despite knowing my confusion and insecurity would return.

Now I can't do that, because my grandma's health would plummet. Staying only in contact with her is complicated, because I would indirectly be exposed to my family and often would receive questions about hating my mom, as she doesn't understand how fucked up that person probably is. She honestly believes no mother would want harm for her child. Or she is an actor in the whole plot. Idk, but probably not.

I have an exam tomorrow that I haven't studied much for. Obviously the reason for this feeling of urgency. I had troubles studying (and reading books in general) since the 6th grade as I would get angry and anxious when even thinking of a book, despite being a \*quick\* learner, which my mom attributed to my lack of discipline due to not needing to study beforehand. I have to note that I certainly \*do\* have discipline, and I \*think\* I proved on a few occasions I have much more discipline and concentration than most people when I have a strong enough motivation to overcome my anxiety when reading. My psychologist says that it isn't lack of discipline, but she didn't elaborate further. This is the last subject beside my master's thesis, and the second chance to get rid of it. Despite that I can't get myself to study enough time in advance, and I don't even get that adrenaline rush that allowed me to study whole subjects in a day or even a night beforehand. I actually kinda don't give a shit, and I partially believe my other life issues are more urgent to solve, as I can go to the exam on summer or even twice at autumn if needed. Still, it would've been so much easier if I was prepared for it tomorrow.

The few friends I have have distanced themselves from me. It's likely due to them being busy with both the work, study and a rich social life (friend says he wants a rest from people haha), but I cannot help but think I'm partially to blame as I don't have much to speak when unhappy and I kinda call them out just to alleviate the stress I feel, meaning I'm at the very least not the most rewarding person to go on a beer with. I do have a lot of non-close friends in the mountaineering group, but I struggle to have a fulfilling social encounters. I want to meet new people, but don't know how.

I'm also worried about my love life. Tbh I'm getting kinda obsessed with getting new romantic/sexual experiences when I'm down, and it causes me to feel lonely and be sexually frustrated (I have a high libido but had only one relationship). I don't know where to meet women, or even men as friends. While I know I would like a very serious relationship, I would be happy with a fwb thing if it's a \*real\* friend thing, but would also like to try anything new as long as it's safe.

I don't have hobbies that aren't exhausting. I'm a programmer, work as a programmer, study programming, and have ""hobby"" projects, but I need something else. I tried drawing (that was kid me's passion), but I don't have inspiration nor know how to put this feeling on paper. I actually always had issues with boredom, and supposedly my mother struggled to occupy me as a kid. I would be happy with more adventurous stuff (as most kids, and adult me), but kids (and people) around me weren't really adventurous. If it's a 6 minutes walk, it's too far (small town mentality). I plan on starting Muay Thai training soon, but I'm still afraid I won't have time for that. I want to discover an activity that would help me relax, as I think I'm not crazy, and that taking pills to reduce this anger would be wrong. I don't wanna be dependant on drugs, and I believe my anger and fear are more than rational.

\*\*The long story you might want to skip\*\*: >!Me and my ex broke up 3/4 months ago, a relationship that lasted a year and a half, that was a long distance relationship for over a year due to her going abroad to study. I wasn't happy with the relationship in the first place, and after spending more than a year sorting my head up so that I become certain I even want a \[monogamous\] relationship, I went crazy after slowly quitting the antidepressants that didn't do anything for me, but caused me to demonify over an afternoon if I forget to take the pill, all while being in the worst situation with the exams, stress over family, and trying to organize my visit to her during her graduation ceremony (I failed to do that). We fought as she thought I wasn't being considerate for her stress, and I stopped contact with her two times thinking I would be okay with never hearing from her due to immense stress and offense she gave me. That lasted two months before me quitting the pills completely and getting back to normal, after which we kinda started speaking again and decided that now that we are both together and stable we can try again, but with real effort to build a relationship this time. I was optimistic, but while thinking on calling it quits due to her lack of effort/incompatibility she dumped me (politely). I was somewhat okay with that, especially since she wanted to stay friends, and I felt that was the best form of our relationship, but since she was getting crazier, more frustrated, and would switch from calm to borderline psychotic in an instant when the conversation reminded her of her insecurities and jealousies during our relationship, I had to quit that friendship completely. She said she doesn't want to speak or be reminded of me for three months, so who knows what she would want next. Now THAT hurts me, because I never lose my emotions for people and I basically have to keep a friend dead in my heart while she is probably getting more and more mentally ill as she def wasn't healthy the last time we heard (calling me at 3am and not understanding that our talk will keep my roommates awake and preventing me from getting ready for bed. I practically had to close the call without a goodbye.)!<

\*\*TLDR\*\*: I don't know what I'm feeling, but I'm in a rut and feel trapped. I need new hobbies, but everything seems so complicated and I'm afraid I won't have time for them.

Obama AMA Anxiety ,3,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Although I was 2000+ comments down, I was proud of myself for posting a question on the Obama AMA today. That is until I realized that I had two typos in my question.

Instantly, I felt that a giant spotlight was on me. This was after all, The President of the United States! The air left my lungs I felt tight and constricted. I wanted to add another comment explaining myself... ""no time to proof read... I was going into a parking garage... I thought my app might quit!""

I wanted to edit the original comment but was afraid it would call more attention to the mistakes and be reposted even lower. As I looked at my flaw, I was conflicted and debate in my head grew. All I could think was ""I blew it"".

I then stepped aside from myself.

I read my full comment again with fresh eyes. I slowed down at the typo, but realized that that it just made me focus even more on the comment. I read it again and just skipped over the flaws and thought, ""Overall, I like the question"". 

I then realized, what a wonderful problem to have. A sitting president answering questions from random contributors in real time, completely unexpected, and then asking my question from the passenger seat of a moving car!

Overcoming Procrastination: Lessons from Famous Figures in History,4,False,False,True,False,0,False," Overcoming Procrastination: Lessons from Famous Figures in History  


Procrastination is a familiar foe to many of us, even to some of the greatest minds in history.  


It's the tendency to put off important tasks until the last minute, even when we know it's not in our best interest.  


But despite its prevalence, procrastination can be overcome. In fact, some of the most famous figures in history struggled with procrastination, yet they found ways to push through it and achieve greatness. Today, I want to share their stories and inspire you to do the same.  


First up is Leonardo da Vinci, one of the greatest artists and inventors of all time. Da Vinci was notorious for procrastinating, and it's said that he often missed deadlines or took years to complete projects.  


But he didn't let his procrastination stop him from achieving greatness. Instead, he found ways to work around it. For example, he would often work on multiple projects simultaneously, switching between them whenever he got bored or stuck.  


He also kept a journal where he wrote down his ideas and sketches, so he could come back to them later and build on them. By embracing his procrastination and finding ways to work with it, da Vinci was able to create some of the most iconic works of art and inventions in history.  


Another famous procrastinator is Abraham Lincoln, one of the most revered presidents in US history. Lincoln was known for putting off tasks until the last minute, which often led to stress and anxiety. But he didn't let procrastination hold him back.  


Instead, he developed a routine that helped him stay focused and productive. He would wake up early every morning and spend several hours reading and studying, which helped him stay informed and prepared for his presidential duties.  


He also surrounded himself with a team of advisors who could help him stay on track and provide guidance when he needed it. By developing a routine and relying on his team, Lincoln was able to overcome his procrastination and lead the country through one of its most challenging times.  


Finally, we have Maya Angelou, a renowned poet, author, and civil rights activist. Angelou was no stranger to procrastination, but she refused to let it define her. Instead, she developed a mantra that helped her stay focused and motivated: ""Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.""  


By focusing on doing her best in the moment, Angelou was able to overcome her procrastination and achieve her goals. She also surrounded herself with a supportive community of writers and artists, who helped her stay inspired and motivated.  


So are you ready to go from procrastination to power?

How do you forgive yourself and escape deep regret ?,1,False,False,True,False,9,False,"I spent 27 years of my life being blind to so many flaws in me. I have always been an introvert who's afraid of confrontation, insecure, spineless and always prefering to stay in my comfort zone. All that led to me having a very small circle of friends, being awkward at social gatherings and struggling with basic social interactions. Which in turn led to me rarely going out, rarely hanging out, spending most of my time indoors at home and trying to stay away as much as possible from any kind of confrontation.

With hindsight, because of all this I missed out on supposedly my best years in college : did not make alot of friends, did not have people I can inquire of, did not build a good resume to prepare for my career because of my fears, ....

Since the begining of last november, I realized that I have been a loser of a man my entire life : I'm currently working at a job that I don't enjoy that much and that doesn't pay well, I have no friends, I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl who's going away to the other side of the world to finish her studies, I'm lonely af and I live in a boring town.

I keep getting overwhelmed by feelings of regret everytime I remember how I used to be, how I used to think and the things I've done. The problem is that my past and the choices I made led to me being here in this situation which makes me very depressed because it is all my fault. I just wish I could go back in time and be more sociable, more outgoing, more honest ... I wish I could go back and make better decisions at all levels personally, professionally, and socially.

The feelings of deep regret, the sadness because of my current situation and the helplessness because that's all gone in the past and there is nothing I can do are just too much. I cannot get out of this state of constant depression which has affected every aspect of my life : I am not performing well at work, I haven't been eating well (I lost 10 Kgs in the last three months), I haven't been sleeping well at all and I am unable to do anything to plan for my future.

I feel stuck and I feel sorry for myself but I also hate myself because I am the only one to blame for everything. Seeing my old classmates doing well in life in every aspect of it also does not help at all. The only time of the day I feel happy is the 3 second in the morning right when I wake up and my memory is still foggy and I can't remember who I am entirely. Just when I remember who I am and what I've done I go back to being depressed.

I feel like I'm on a highway to my inevitable death unless I get to escape this regret pit that I've fallen into.

Shows and books that have scenes without resolution or cliffhangers feed my depression,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello. For some goddamn reason I've developed some kind of obsession with sad scenes/cliffhangers in tv shows and books. Cliff-hangers or especially sad scenes without resolution started triggering my obsessive thoughts about them and I hate that because it takes joy from one of the few things that used to give it. Alongside those thoughts sometimes anxiety/depression manifests as a knot in the chest. It's such an annoyance because I know that everything is fine with me, medically speaking and I am not even anxious about that and yet I can still feel it.

What’s a good alternative to therapy for someone who can’t afford it?,3,False,False,True,False,8,False,"
Hey, everyone, UC here. I’ve known for a long time there’s something desperately wrong with me, probably fundamentally broken (which sucks to accept but eh fuck it I have to or I’ll never do anything about it). The problem comes with the fact I don’t know what I can do about it. For most people on here, the answer is to go to a therapist and get support, which is definitely the Good Ending. 

Unfortunately, I have a lot of barriers in the way that are stopping me. In no particular order:

1. I go to medical school in another state than my home state, so I don’t have my PCP down here and I can’t just book an emergency appointment with him while away for 2.5 months at a time (and only home for a week each break). Plus that also means I can’t get any sort of diagnosis from him for whatever is wrong or any prescriptions (much less let insurance take care of the costs which I’ll elaborate on below)

2. The insurance I get through my parents is comprehensive, but the itemized billing they get would tell them that I’m getting therapy, which is absolutely NOT ACCEPTABLE. If they know, I could get my funds cut off in the middle of semester and I can’t get more loans until the next cycle (meaning what I have is what I get for the next few months). On the other hand, the insurance I get through my school has such a high deductible and copay

3. According to my school, they treat us as if we’re living in the “real world” and the real world doesn’t do “free”, so they don’t offer mental health resources outside of a mindfulness app, which is cool and all except very impersonal and I feel like I’d need a personal touch.

4. The way that my school’s former Dean treated one student who had depression and had to be hospitalized scares me into not wanting to even RISK being involuntarily confined. Suffice it to say, he came to her hospital room to tell her if she couldn’t get a hold of herself then she isn’t cut out to be a doctor. Then he convened the disciplinary board to force her to drop out, which she did, with no recourse to the debt she accrued. 
5. I don’t have time to be confined right now.
6. There’s no circumstance, “sin”, or particular person who is making me the way I am, so I’m not even sure that a professional could find anything wrong with me.

With these problems in mind, I’m struggling to find a way to make things better. I feel like I’m actively rotting away without any lifeline, and it sucks.

Is my sadness normal? ,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I realized back in 2019 that I was sad most of the time.

I hugged my mom and told her that I’m sad and that the sadness is becoming a permanent part of me. I told her I wanted to see someone who could help me and she said we could go the next day after school. It was also the first and only time that I cried in my mother’s arms. We didn’t go to get help. 

My mom told me it’s just school pressure and teen anxiety. That was almost five years ago today. Things got better, I can handle it now but I’m still not happy. 

I’ll go out with friends for example and just for a split second I get this feeling of pure happiness, the kind of happiness I hadn’t felt since I was a kid.  

What I’m asking, is if that split second happiness I felt is something I am supposed to be feeling regularly? I don’t really know what it feels to be happy. I know it sounds weird but when I go out with friends or family I don’t really feel something. I feel numb inside, like it doesn’t matter that I’m there.

Depression doesn't end...,5,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Depression doesn't end...
Did you realise how bad the society
treats/concentrates on suicidal or mind broken people. We always see in documentaries like this guy has this disease or this guy is gay and you should respect him but nothing about mind broken / depressed people. I am not saying we are in a higher position or should get treated better. I am saying we should be at an equal position. Then they would probably use like ""They die."" or something like that as an excuse but most of us die to doing suicide not accepting this horrible fate and they mostly don't listen I heard so many people make jokes like ""Ughh why would you do suicide."". They should be asking why not the reason we die is not us it is them and they don't care. Did you ever see one post saying that his psychiatrist cured his depression. NO you probably didn't. They earn money by doing pretty much nothing and think they are doing hard work. The little population that comes out of this horrible fate does it them selfs in a long process losing friends and maybe even family. 

To clarify how hard it is to get out of depression let me tell people who don't have depression what is going on in this broken mind.

As we turn depressed we start seeing the world in its true colors. The bad society / People / Life itself everything is pain. You start thinking philosophically and that is good that is the true nature of humans. Thinking philosophically not painted in the paint of society or medics. The reason it is good and we are still depressed is that society doesn't think this is right and tries to paint is in that colorless color of it. If everyon ewoild have this kind of mindset we wouldn't be depressed. Working towards equality of eveyone not just visible things that we think have to be fixed so we can see no differentiation between them and us. We are also depressed cause so many people say depression should be cured but still make fun of people that have. When I was a kid we had a really nostalgic guy that had suicidal thoughts and there were girls and boys everywhere making jokes about him. I wanted to do something but what could I do. I would get outcasted myself. He started thinking a little bit more philosophically after that too. 

The more we get depressed the more philosophically we think and that makes us realise how bad humanity is and the more depressed we get. If you think you have depression because you are sad you aren't you are just sad and nothing like us. The longer you have depression the harder it is to get out and at one time almost impossible. The thing you get depression from is the thing you concentrate most on with philosophy but everthing comes to humanity at the end. It is all our fault making everthing like this. Painting our own colors to grey...

So people don't ask I have depression since I am 9 because of prejudice of my looks and thinking and many more things. I wont tell how old I am I hope you understand. I wish you keep on thinking philosophically or start thinking like that and I wish you a wonderful day/night/noon/morning/evening.",False,False,depression,1007649,New,2024,2,Low,1,25,3084,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0
[Advice] How I cured my trauma,85,True,False,True,False,8,False,"Trauma is still being researched...

**What I know about trauma:**

Trauma is a stuck emotion that you didn't process when the stressful event happened. So that emotion is now locked in your body, which causes problems with your physical and spiritual self. Cause the energy cant flow through your body freely!

I look at trauma as a fraction of your spirit/soul/self. Like you are not connected with your inner child (at least in my experience, because my trauma happened when I was a child).

If you don't know you have trauma this is where you can see signs and symptoms: [https://www.cascadebh.com/behavioral/trauma/signs-symptoms-effects/](https://www.cascadebh.com/behavioral/trauma/signs-symptoms-effects/)

**But in my experience my untreated trauma left me with;**

* Hating myself, despising myself
* Thinking no one loves me / I am alone
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Negative thoughts
* Harmful Addictions (One of the root causes of overuse of drugs and alcohol is untreated trauma, I used drugs and alcohol to cope with the pain)
* PAIN

My benefits of curing trauma are immeasurable (because many things happened in between), but it lead me to Happiness, Peace, Loving Myself, Finding and understanding who loves me and who is my true support, curing depression, Positive more confident thoughts, and beliefs, Less and less anxiety, dealing with stress better, Understanding myself, what I want to do, life, everything much much better, Better control and expression of emotions... and so much more.

So if you have trauma treat it immediately cause this is what probably is holding you and your success. So I would recommend you treat, it will be life-changing!

**Here is my story, what cause my trauma, and how I treated it:**

**How I got traumatized;**

My Father first divorced my mother and then killed himself. (Divorce is enough trauma for the child because the child inherently thinks it's his fault, an abstinent parent in the household is always bad as well....+ you probably thought as a child your father and mother were soulmates, or something like that (I did))

**How long it went:**

Because I was hiding from the fact I was depressed, (I didn't want to admit it as a young boy that I was depressed and shit, though it was a correct way to go) my depression, anxiety, and just a shitty existence, existence full of coping and the pain went as long as for 12 years. After 12 years, information that I am traumatized came to me by accident. 2 years have passed from this information!

After the realization that I am traumatized, I started to inquire and learn more about trauma, and I have started to treat it... myself, (without antidepressants, modern cures for depression and psychologists) with information that was either in books, the internet, or within myself! (But that is me, to each his own, there is no shame in seeking help! I say that I did it alone so you can see its curable, even when DIY)

**How I treated trauma:**

* A lot of writing, with pen and paper... **DO NOT DO IT ON A COMPUTER**... writing forgiveness letters to my father, family, younger self, journaling, writing eulogies, writing promises, feelings... just writing what I wanted to (You can also burn the letters after if you want).
* And then when I wrote, feelings came back, feelings of sadness and sorrow, the feelings I have been avoiding half of my life.  **THIS IS IMPORTANT**, When those feelings came up I didn't avoid them, I didn't bury them inside,  I just felt them and stood with them, when I wanted to cry I cried. And this caused me to feel sad for like 2 months, and I cried a lot during those 2 months, but after a while, I stopped crying and everything was kinda mellow then. It was alright!
* Visualization before sleeping. I visualized myself as a kid(when it happened), and as an adult, in both the same place and time (LIKE THE PICTURE BELOW!). And I talked and felt like an adult, and I talked and felt like a kid. I Visualized kid me separated from my current self, and me jumping down the deep dark hole (let's say rabbit hole), to come and rescue the kid. Connect me and myself! Aka my fragmented spirit. This also caused a lot of crying

[I visualized myself as both a kid and adult](https://preview.redd.it/0b6zf69i0n391.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=8269df2b421649d7b392376b7cddf400a6338151)

**What I said to my kid and what also helped me treat my trauma:**

* Understand that the negative things needed to happen, it was destiny, and it's what will make you great! I don't know a one truly great person who had an easy life. Because that happened you have the opportunity now to heal yourself, and then help others heal themselves!
* You reacted the best way you could to the situation, do not hate yourself for the reaction, it's good you survived for so long, alone. You did a good job, I am proud of you! (you're never really alone, though the Cosmos is always with you)
* Forgiveness, forgive your father because he was alone as well, he didn't know better, he was in probably more trouble and turmoil than you are, were.
* I will guard and protect you, now you can relax, you are safe with me!

&#x200B;

**Honorable notice:**

* I started to return to nature and started to spend more time in nature and less time in front of a screen or in a cafe. **MAN IS NATURE!**
* Also, this is my view on them, maybe you have a different view, but they helped me change my life for the better (I used them twice) MUSHROOMS. I had two sessions with mushrooms, and it helped me to understand life and myself better. I asked mushrooms for knowledge, and they gave me knowledge! \*I Don't think you should take mushrooms or anything like that, everyone is their own person, to me, it worked, to you it may worsen the situation, who knows, **do what suits you**""

**Knowledge is the Truth and the Truth Heals!** **Knowledge Heals!**

Also, mushrooms are now researched and used for healing mental illness in some psychological institutes, in exchange for anti-depressants and modern pills! Google it if you doubt me. Also, they were tested before as well in the 50s 60s in America, but it was shut down by the Government.

I hope this will be helpful! If you have any questions write in the comments or DM me if you're shy!

How to get instant and effortless motivation instantly (Guide),0,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Hello fellas, whether this one fits this website or not, it's up to the moderators which can chose to delete it,  it's a tehcnique i have used to  develop myself,. It's psychological technique we all just need many times a day. 📷

Do you have these days, where you just can't get you ass to do something? Clean your house, clean that ugly dish, do that task you need to do?You just try to push yourself to do it but whatever you do, you find yourself anyway procrastinating your ass off with porn or Netflix in the end?

I have good news though, this can be easily fixed for things you want to do, where fear is not involved!The problems with people doing things today are, that they logically try to push themselves to do things when they aren't feeling to do it.

We must remember we people are emotion based creatures, 90% of the actions, successes, and behaviors are based on how we feel, which is our limbic brain that controls it. So it gives not any sense, try to force ourselves with our logical brain to do something we do not feel doing, emotions always win over us, always, especially fear. Spiritual people call the limbic brain the subconscious mind, some psychists calls it the unconscious mind. But we do not care about it here.

The thing is:We can't directly control the limbic/emotional brain, but we can indirectly, visualization is a good tool to do it, but this is not some law of attraction bullshit, but a realistic visualization technique.

So here it is!

**Instant and effortless motivation technique**

Instead of pushing yourself like a dolphin that is stranded on the sea-sand and want to get back to the sea, you are going to opposite the equation, you will get so motivated, that you can't stop yourself from doing the thing you did not want to do tihihi 📷

What you want to do, and how everyone should do, is to put some firepower in your limbic/emotional brain, which is the most powerful part of the brain we have and drives our behaviors. We are emotional creatures, emotions controls us!

Let's take an example:

Let's say you have a dirty kitchen, shit lies all over the place. Dirty plates, dirty forks, and knives. The kitchen table is dirty. Just look at it, how crap it looks like. Look at it in real life, not in your mind.

Now when you look at it, then now visualize how you want it to look like, your goal, not the process, but the ***END*** result. While you look at the shit, then visualize how you want it to look like. Now close your eyes, and visualize precisely how you want it to look like.

Ask yourself: ""How nice would it be to have a completely clean kitchen, that shines when the sun is coming up"" 📷 Now visualize very precisely in your mind your perfect clean kitchen without plates, forks all over the place. Just your clean, shiny kitchen table free of things.Ask yourself questions, that will motivate you and put some firepower in your limbic/emotional brain.

\-""How nice would it be to be an organized/adult man/woman, that cleans everything up and make it look shiny and beautiful?""-""How good would be, have a completely free table of things and that shines, as it so much clean!""

Keep asking and asking, visualizing a still picture of your goal, and let the positive emotions build up, let it spread in your entire body.Now let it build up a few mins, and open your eyes and see the shit again. Now you limbic/emotion brain begins to plan how to solve the problem.

Now instead of pushing yourself like a stranded dolphin, you will be pulled to the task, haha, you will not be able to stop. You will do it automatically like on autopilot.

Now this is the important thing, now when you are cleaning your shit up, keep having your end result in your mind, until your finish your task, and bam you have done something in 5 min, you procrastinated about in weeks.

**Everywhere**You can do this in any situation where fear is not involved, learn by yourself how you can use it. Another example, If it where a task for school or whatever we can do, it's the same process, you see that you have not done a shit of the task, you look at the empty word document or whatever and then you visualize and ask yourself questions how nice it would be to have completely done task, being a good student, and get a good grade after the task is delivered to the school 📷

**So basically,lets recap** 📷

1. First, you must see in real life, the thing that you do not like. Be frustrated about it.
2. You look at the thing/things you do not like, and then you must visualize it precisely how you want it to be already **'DONE'** in your mind. Close your eyes and visualize how you want it to be.
3. You must visualize the end result in your mind, not how you going to do it, but just as it is ***already*** done, visualize the goal in your mind and not the process.
4. Ask questions to pull yourself to do it, instead of pushing yourself, feel good about the questions to put firepower in the limbic/emotional brain. examples are up there \^\^ as I posted 📷
5. Now, wait for the positive emotion, building up. Keep asking questions and visualizing precisely your end result, feel good about it. Spread the emotion in your entire body, now you will feel pulled to the thing you want to do! Instead of pushing yourself to do it!!
6. Let the emotion build up from 1-3 min.
7. Now when you are motivated to do it, keep looking at the unwanted thing/things, while you have your visualization in mind and feel good about it, until you have done your goal 📷 You will automatically do the thing, you will be pulled, like an autopilot is working for you.

Hope this knowledge can help you guys, it has really helped me! 📷

**FAQ**

**When does the technique not work?**The technique works in all situations except where fear is involved, and sadly we fear many different things.

**Example 1:**You are a guy in a bar and look at a good looking woman you want to seduce and talk to. You use the motivation process and have a goal to have her in your home this night, but fear of retjection is invloved, then this tehinique does not work. You can do it over and over but it will not work. Fear will block it and 'fear' is the strongest emotion we humans have.

**Example 2:**You are a woman, that have spared some money and want to quit the crap job and want to take a risk and start a business. You use the motivation process to have a goal to open a business. But fear of failure is involved and you are afraid to fail and end up having no money. So you chose to stay in the job.

&#x200B;

**Fear**

To solve these problems, we must remove 'fear' from the equation, once 'fear' is removed we will go effortlessly for our goals, fully motivated 📷

**What about situations we can't directly look on?**Let's say you have an empty house and you want your house full of friends and party. Then look at this empty house your have, and then visualize how nice it would be to invite friends and have a house party etc.

&#x200B;

**Is this some NLP shit?**

No it has nothing to do with NLP.

CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn’t. Here’s what I mean.,674,False,False,True,False,31,False,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you’re unhappy, or even if you’re happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. 

That’s not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can.

Please start exercising,1574,True,False,True,False,213,False,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals.

I’m kind of embarrassed by how much taking care of a cat has improved my mental health.,210,True,False,True,False,19,False,"So I’ve dealt with chronic depression my whole life, I have a lot of strategies to help and I’m almost in my thirties, I’m proud that I’ve become pretty functional. But I still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and I know I will again in my life. But I can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and don’t let things spiral until my life implodes like I used to. Always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:

“There are certain things
That I have to do.
Day to day just to keep it at bay,
You wouldn’t believe if you knew”

And I’ve been doing okay with that. But I let things in my personal life, the parts I can keep private or aren’t a “big deal” slip consistently. My room is always a mess, I let my beard get big and bushy even though I (and everyone I know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what I could do today sort of stuff. And not even to do fun stuff, I just kind of dither and worry about the things I’m not doing. 

A few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. One of my roommates left the place and didn’t take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. The cat decided I was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if I didn’t let him hang out in my room. I was reluctant to adopt him because I was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for the commitment. Finally the lease holder said he was going to take him to the humane society that afternoon, I said bye to him with some sadness, and went to work. but he had only been “my cat” for a week so I figure better he go sooner before he got too attached. He’s an adorable sweet boy and only a year old so I didn’t think he would languish too long and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.

While I was at work it really stuck in my craw. I just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. But when I got home he was still there! I decided screw it, he’s my cat now. Told my roommates I’d take responsibility for him and dubbed him Jonesy, cause he looks like the cat from alien.

I’ve been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved In pretty much every way. There is the mental health improvement from having an animal around, he’s a very affectionate cat. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. But there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. I’ve been keeping my room clean because he will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks, so empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go. I always actively
play with him when I get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (I don’t answer text, listen to music, watch TV, I just play with Jonesy) is very calming and centering. Cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. I’m drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. I usually feel like all the little things I don’t do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life I feel like I’m catching up.

I’m straight up embarrassed by how much I love this animal. He’s my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. I can’t control much in the world but I can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. I know there will still be some dark times ahead but I feel like I have a new ally in the daily struggle.

I was medicated for anxiety/depression for many years, but found that the medication made me so exhausted that I wasn’t able to function (falling asleep during inappropriate times and sleeping through important life events). So for about 4 months now I’ve been off of medication I took for 10+ years (regardless of the lethargy- I took the fatigue over the anxiety). 

I’m just at my wits end. My house and living space is a mess, feeding myself and up-keep in terms of hygiene is really hard for me. If I’m not scrolling or watching something to distract myself, I’m so anxious and aware of my nausea. 

I’ve been dealing with gastrointestinal issues for the past 3 months. I went off work in mid-November and the only day I’ve gone in so far was once last week. I’m in a high-stress job and I go in tomorrow. I find that my health anxiety is through the roof. I’m constantly worrying about throwing up at work or having to leave early (because I’m responsible for about 30 other people during the day). I love what I do, but when feeling sick, I find that my anxiety around being sick is debilitating. 

When I’m at home and not working (so, a typical day for me lately), I’m scrolling to distract myself. I only connect with my one family member, and don’t chat much with friends (mostly because I’m anxious and find it hard to reach out and communicate with friends). I find it hard to keep up with laundry and chores, and don’t know how to stop myself from distracting myself from reality to avoid stress and responsibility. I just really need some compassion and connection, and hoped this as the right place to find understanding, and maybe even advice.

I can't learn a trade because of my complications, I just had my hearing tested in order to be a   firefighter today (the one thing I wanted to do), and I can't even do that because of my car accident that my DAD BASICALLY LED ME TO made me lose half of my hearing. I always call people out when they are being rude or disrespectful to me or others, but I never receive the same treatment. Jesus taught us to give and don't expect anything in return. Well I think that's a load of shit. I give people respect, and they disrespect me, and once I start treating that disrespect with disrespect, I BECOME THE PUNCHING BAG. For example, for SIX MONTHS, my roommate has constantly left dirty dishes piled in the  sink, and yesterday (after communicating with him to do them for the longest time, EVEN THOUGH I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE HE IS FUCKING 28 YEARS OLD AND SHOULD KNOW BETTER TO HAVE COMMON DECENCY  AND NOT NEED A 20 YEAR OLD TO WIPE HIS ASS) I took the dirty dishes that he left piled up in the sink (cus I was tired of always cleaning up after him), put them in a garbage bag, left them in front of his room with a note telling him to clean them. Was this a dick move? Yes. Was it justified after MONTHS and MONTHS of disrespect? Yes. My other roommates and I called him out on being dirty last night, the roommate in question, J, says that me putting the dishes in a bag in front of his room is disrespectful, and then he deflects saying I have caused problems and left my dishes out (I haven't) and ruined the stove (also not true, I clean after myself every time, that is why I am pissed in the first place), lying to ALL OF OUR FACES ABOUT ME, AND THEY TAKE HIS SIDE. I AM FUCKING DONE. My roommates takes J's side saying I was being disrespectful after dealing with MONTHS of disrespect, and now I can't even do the one thing I wanted, become a firefighter because I couldn't pass a fucking hearing test. I can never seem to take a win at life, no matter how hard I try. I eat clean, I exercise, I sleep well, I'm nice, I do EVERYTHING that is supposed to make my mental health better, but it doesn't change a damn thing.

Do you think this would give people profound insights about the PTSD?,0,True,False,True,False,1,False,"As someone who's gone through some form of PTSD experiences, I think that it is meaningful for me to share my experiences with people. I would like to know what kind of insights my writing below would give to you. Also I would want you all to know that PTSD is more common than most people think. Maybe someone who you interact with normally, someone who smiles always might have gone through the PTSD as well. I think this is often one of the hidden aspects some of us have.

Also, as my first language is not English, I borrowed the language power of chatgpt to improve clarity for my writing.

It is helpful if you can tell me your opinions or what you felt about this.

&#x200B;

I have managed to recover relatively rapidly and successfully from the PTSD induced by approximately 6-7 years of childhood abuse from my former biological father. I had gone through countless harrowing experiences at a spiritual and mental level. Before the recovery began, there was a period where I lay in bed for an entire day, never moving my body, rarely waking up, speaking no single word and showing no facial expressions. I believe that period lasted for about a month or two in real-world time.

During that time, my mother took care of me, bringing food to my bed, checking on me, and trying to engage with me. She continued to help me, even though I couldn't make facial expressions, didn't speak a single word, and she had to feed me because I couldn't manage to eat by myself. At a profoundly deep mental level, I was aware that my mother often spoke to me, and I recognized her as a protective figure shielding me from my abusive father. While I may have appeared lifeless externally, my mind was flooded with countless flashbacks and intense experiences at a hyper-spiritual and mental level. During this stage, I slept most of the time and rarely woke up. I would surmise that my brain was incredibly busy dealing with all the phenomena, flashbacks, and memories that were beyond human comprehension.

During this time, I lived in a mental world dominated by dirty shades, primarily dark red, black, and white. The colour was purely that of the blood. Over there, I was surronded by a rapid and intense storm of the blood colour. In this mental world, human-like existences or spiritual beings would occasionally appear. They conveyed messages to me, although I couldn't fully comprehend the content of their communication. Soon after, they would vanish into the storm swirling around me. I distinctly recall encountering a married couple in that mental or spiritual world, reminiscent of an angel and a kind-hearted man. I didn't understand why they were there within my turmoil, but I felt embraced by their god-like kindness, and they displayed profound empathy for my pain. They were really kind, understanding and sweet. I interpreted them as messengers of the gods, responsible for visiting the world where someone in suffering resides.

As time passed in my mental realm, the storm gradually dissipated, and the world around me appeared much clearer and more transparent, though the colors remained grotesque, resembling the shade of blood. Strangely, I found that color beautiful in its own way.

A few days later in that world, I had a profound encounter with someone. She might have been another messenger of God, but she was quite different from the messengers I had met earlier. She spoke to me in a strong yet resolute tone, saying, ""You should not come to this side; you must return to your world as soon as possible. There are still many things left for you to do there. It's too early for you to be here. You can return to this place after you've lived your life in your world. The next time I will see you will be when you come to this side for real.""

I immediately realized that the mental world I had been in was actually a place we go to after finishing our lives in this human world. In my opinion, it was neither heaven nor hell, but more like a place where we go through numerous stages of flashbacks and memories gained during our life as a human with a physical body. After the messenger told me that, I made the decision to continue my life in the real world (the human world). I first resolved to leave behind that world of blood-like colors, neither heaven nor hell. As I attempted to depart that world, the storm had disappeared. It even felt like I had gained control over that mental world, becoming a ruler of that space.

Now, I don't fully understand the exact process, but eventually, I found myself at a place where I needed to sign a form to return to the real world. There were three doors in front of me. Each door represented a different path of life I would lead once I returned to the real world. According to my memories, the left door offered the option to continue living under the shelter of my mother indefinitely, meaning I would never get a job or leave the house until around the age of 40, when my mother would pass away. The middle door offered me the option to lead a very ordinary life that anyone would deserve to live, but I would forget most of my life history from my early childhood in exchange. The last door offered me the option to live the most challenging and tough life, with many obstacles, including PTSD, flashbacks, conflicts with my mother, and everything else. However, out of all the options, it allowed for the possibility of becoming the most successful and rapidly recovering from PTSD. After contemplating which door to enter, I ultimately chose the last one.

I entered the door, and there was one more room. In that room, elegant frames and flowers adorned the space. In the middle of the room, there was a sign-in form for choosing this option. The sign-in form asked me, ""Are you sure you want to go with this path? You will never be able to change this decision until you die and return here."" I signed the form and exited that mental world. Around the same time, I woke up in the real world on my own, probably after being inactive for one or two months. I uttered my first word, and my sister noticed, exclaiming, 'My brother said a word!' She informed my mother, who was equally astonished by my sudden return to speech and movement. I began moving my body again after a period of inactivity, breaking free from my emotional shell to restart my life.

I sexually assaulted my best friend when we were both drunk and I have lost the will to live.,0,False,False,True,False,8,False,"To give more context I have known this girl for some time, to the point I'd consider her a best friend. We've hung out a lot and she's drunkenly made out with two of my best friends on separate occasions.
I'm 18, I just graduated from highschool as of June. I decided to take a year off to make some money and then go to University next year.
I invite her (I'll call her K) to a party my friend was having, everyone was having a good time but then one of my other friends (D) was getting very creepy and odd towards K so instead of hanging with the herd, I decided to do a decent friend move and get him to back off.
Later into the night she's trying to sleep and D is follwing her around so I get the host (C) to come get him. Well that's going on I casually kissed K and then we proceeded to makeout a little, and asking if it was okay.
C comes back with D and tells K about a room she can crash in. Around this time everything was super hazy (shots of everclear were given out; it was my first time drinking it) and one way or another we were both in the room and in the bed. I started to get handsy and I kept asking if it was okay and she said it was.
I wake up from her leaving the room the next morning, saying ""gotta drive ____ home for work, see ya later"" or something along those lines. I don't remember what happened at that very instance as I was still recovering and was still drunk. Around late noonish I woke up. Thinking everything was cool, I felt really gross by what I did but I assumed everything was groovy as we were both very drunk and the worse thing that would have happen is I fingered her. Which I asked was okay and she said it was. But as I said I was pretty ashamed of myself and didn't think much of it. As it was consensual.
The next day I talked to her but the whole convo seemed off and later into the day I asked what was up. She said what happened was a mistake but that it wasn't my fault, it was just the situation. She said it would be best if we weren't friends and I decided to tell her about when I was raped at 15. How I had no control, felt helpless even when I said no. I told her that I never intended to do that to her and that was the reason I kept asking if it was okay, but that I felt awful and that it would honestly never happen again because I loved her (as a friend) so much and I'd never want to hurt her.
She accepted the apology and we made plan to hang on Wednesday (party was sunday) when she came down with another one of my friends things were off again. She seemed distant and didn't look me in the eye.
After that, a day or two later she was acting weird. I called her and she said after seeing me in person she just couldn't be friends with me. We both go emotional (mostly me) but K insisted it wasn't my fault, it was just the situation. We agreed to keep our friendship on hold.
A lot of stuff happened between then and now, the gist is we agreed to just be casual friends but then on another drunken night I told my best friend (CA) about how she felt like punching him and stuff. K somehow got told (our one bestie who will be KT was texting me about it and she read what I was texting her it was KT told me) and her friend sent me a snap of her saying ""I'm going to fight you"" and I broke down in tears. On that day I thought keeping my distant was just for the best and decided just not to be friends as the situation escalated because of me again and I just wanted to stop hurting her. I was also told by KT that K reacted poorly, even when I explained that I was drunk. So distance was for the best. I asked KT to send a ""have a good futute, please understand the situation and I'm really sorry"" KT told me she really didn't respond but was happy I sent her best wishes.
A couple weeks go by and I'm feeling a little better, something I didn't mention was that as soon as the ""situation"" happened I couldn't fall asleep, I would cry myself to sleep almost ever night feeling awful and shitty. I had lost all motivation to do anything and was in a very sad state. But, I was getting better. In that time period I started seeing a therapist and eventually started taking medication for my depression. I decided to block K on most social medias with exception of Facebook, as I still wanted to make sure she was okay in some light. Also I thought blocking people was pretty extreme. So I decided to keep K on my Facebook.
A week goes by, and now we are roughly two days away from today. I don't pay much mind to K but notice she's going to this Halloween and I was like ""rad okay, maybe I'll go to"" so I said I was going on the page, left a witty comment and went about my day. An hour or so later I noticed wasn't going anymore. I tried searching her name, and I was blocked. I was a little upset. I proceeded to talk KT about this, as I have been thw whole time because instead of getting my anger out on K. telling her how lame it was because I thought we were cool but that it was whatever. One thing leads to another and I was saying that I couldn't even imagine continuing a friendship with K because I felt she juvenile and childish for acting the way she has been, especially when it came to our relationship. That she persisted it was the situation but would treat me terribly during the entire situation, that she never realized how I've been feeling like a bordeline rapist and she didn't say anything to comfort me that I wasn't.
KT finally told me how K had been feeling, you see KT was a buffer, for me and Kesley. We basically would dump our feelings on KT so we wouldn't get mad at each other. It worked and if one person said something about the other she would tell the other. From what KT told me, K was basically blowing this out of proportion. I was upset about it because our relationship was done because of one awful night. I digress. K told KT I sexually assaulted her. She has told three of her friends (including KT) as well. I was having a panic attack, I thought things were finally done and we could look past the situation and move on either as friends or not. But I didn't think things were ever, ever this bad. K explained to KT, even though she was saying okay with it, she thought I would take the hint that it wasn't okay. Immediately I felt like shit, I sexually assulted my best friend, and have been nothing but bitter about her thinking that the ""situation"" was to blame. But it was all my fault she felt this way, K also said that whenever my name was mentioned or she saw me online she would feel anxious. When she was starting to feel better she saw I commented on that Halloween page and decided to block me. Then went straight to KT about it. Just as I have. KT told me she believes her as has known her for much longer then I have, and she never had a reason to lie. KT also said she believes me, because she knows how much I care about people and she knows I'm a good person, and considering what happened to me she knows I would never do the same. She knows that I never pressured my girlfriend (now ex, this would have been when I was 17) of a year into sex, that in every other situation at a party or club when I'm invited to have relations or makeout with a girl I always say no, no matter how drunk I am. So she doesn't understand why I did what I did, I don't either.
I felt sick to my stomach after hearing all of that, all I could do was cry. I hurt someone I truly care for and had just completely lost the will to live. I decided that I was going to take my life. As I can't live knowing I hurt someone I care about so much. To the point where if she saw me she felt anxious. The next day I had a job interview. I was up till 4 crying and feeling like shit. I looked it too and was late to the interview, but somehow I got the job.
Now we're here. Today. I just walked home from work (as I don't have a license) I have planned everything out, I don't want to do it today but at some point this month. I have thought about it a lot through all of August ( it happened at the beginning of that month) but I now feel it's the only way to set things right. but I want help. I still want to live. But I just can't find a reason to. I'm a monster, I honestly just can't handle this. I don't have my future planned out and now I'm an equal to every other rapist you see in the news. So many other awful things have happened, and when it did despite feeling like my life was meaningless, I was still happy. I found a reason to be happy knowing I was getting better, making more friends, and that I was a good person. I was a social guy who was a friend to all.
But now I don't even have that, I don't feel like I'm a good person. But I still want to live and I have no one to turn to. (My therapist is on holiday until the 19th) I looked up my situation on the internet and saw a similar post about someone who had a done something similar.

can we talk about dissociation?,5,False,False,True,False,4,False,"I'm new to reddit, so please excuse me if I'm making any etiquette fumbles. I was diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago, and the event that triggered it happened 18 months ago.

I also have OCD, and my obsessions often center around fears of medical and mental illnesses...so its essentially a worst fear realized. I absolutely hate and fear the idea that I'm not 100% in control of my thoughts and not 100% present and in touch with reality at all times. Before making the connection and realizing the events were dissociating, I just chalked them up to being tired or stressed. Now I feel constantly on guard, waiting for it to happen again, and I know if it does it will send me into a panic attack.

Failure and Rejection Make You STRONGER,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hqH4p1hkZA

What's up bros, I thought I would share a video and a post that I made here hopefully it can bring some positivity to you 

Growing up as a kid, I was always scared of my own shadow. I lived in a constant state of self-consciousness and as a result repressed my human expression in all its rawness and uniqueness. I was always calculating in my mind the most appropriate thing to say in social situations to avoid being judged and made fun of by other people. The fear of rejection by society was eating me up from inside out leaving very little room for my true self to express himself. The fear of failure was eluding me like a shadow in the dark. I didn’t want to say the wrong thing or make mistakes and as a result I was afraid to try anything new where I would risk making mistakes and failing. 

I knew deep down I had to overcome the fear of failure. I was so afraid of making mistakes that I decided to make it my mission in life to become a fearless soul. From there on, I started learning how to live outside my comfort zone and so a new chapter in my life began. I can tell you this, the minute you decide to step out of your comfort zone is the minute you declare a state of chaos and turmoil in your life. It is similar to throwing yourself to the wolves, and your mission is to come back leading them. You are about to experience a never ending battle with your own ego. You will experience failure and rejection more than most people around you because most people don’t have the courage to try new things and put themselves out there in vulnerable situations where the odds or rejection and failure seem to be high, at least in the beginning. 

You will start to question yourself in so many ways. Have I gone crazy? What drives me to take such chances? Maybe I should just shut my mouth and get back to my little protective shell to avoid embarrassment, failure, and rejection. Your ego will constantly try to bring you back to a fearful state of mind. And guess what, often times you will listen to your ego and get back to your little shell even after you tried to step outside your comfort zone. However, that little voice of courage deep within you, the one that drove you to step outside your comfort zone in the first place will come back and talk to you, and your job is to feed that courageous voice and force yourself to step outside your comfort zone once again and open yourself up for failure and rejection. 
There is a certain excitement that builds up within you each time you are about to do something new, a sweet little drug known as adrenaline which I happen to be addicted to. I like to call adrenaline the drug of courage and liberation. Adrenaline doesn’t care if you succeed or fail, all it wants to do is protect you from a perceived physical or emotional danger, and that’s where you become in a fight or flight state of mind. The trick is to train your mind and body to respond to adrenaline by fighting instead of flying. This means whatever scares you let that be talking to a girl, confronting someone, jumping out of an airplane or experiencing failure in any shape or form must be faced head on in order to train your subconscious to fight instead of flight in dangerous situations. 

The more you expose yourself to seemingly dangerous situations, the more you fail and get rejected, the more you get out of your comfort zone, the more you realize these fears were simply illusions in your mind set there to limit your potential and capacity and keep you timid in a system that feeds on robotic and fearful behaviour. The adrenaline resides and eventually a fearful thought that was once your arch enemy becomes your best friend. But before you form that friendship with your fear, you have to go through chaos and inner turmoil, and you have to be prepared to make a lot of mistakes along the way before you conquer your fear of rejection and failure. Then, you will develop a love story with failure and your life will never be the same.

I have always been an very anxious person, 
and I've been worrying a lot about normal things. I have never been on a rollercoaster for an example, i’m afraid of thunder, and I HATE flying. I feel ashamed of everything I do, and I often lock my self up in my room just laying in my bed, thinking about how embarrassing I am.

But for the last few months I've started to become scared of everything and I'm constantly making up scenarios in my head. I believe there’s terrorist on every train i take,  and that the worlds gonna be hit by a really big meteor and wash out everything. I think somebody’s gonna shoot me when I walk in public and all sorts of stuff.

Maybe it doesn’t really seem like a big problem, but I think about this CONSTANTLY. I can’t sleep, I can’t feel relaxed, this is ruining my life..

Do what the person you want to become would do,117,False,False,True,False,7,False,"  

You are what you do

Often when you hear about abusers, criminals, and even murderers people will say, “Oh that’s not the real him. Deep down John is a good guy.” People believe that we are defined by our internal thoughts and feelings. That if we think good things we’re a good person. If we hope for wellness in others we’re benevolent. But I submit that someone who repeatedly does bad things is a bad person (leaving aside for a moment the complicated psychological reasons they do those things and the fact that I have another blog post that is literally titled “There are no bad people.”) And it’s easy to prove. While we may buy the premise that some guy who constantly abuses his partners is a good guy “deep down,” we certainly don’t buy the necessary corresponding argument. Imagine saying, “Mother Theresa: total bitch. Sure she did all those great things, but deep down, horrible person.” Of course not. It doesn’t make any sense. Someone who did all that good has to be a good person.

From that it follows that we are what we repeatedly do. But how do we square that with our self-concept and our identities? We often fail to achieve lasting change because the habits and behaviors associated with that change do not conform to our self-concept. Self-concept is destiny. The most powerful force in the human personality is the desire to be consistent with who we believe we are. So we stop working out because that’s not what a fat person like me would do. We stop working hard because that’s not what a lazy person like me does. No matter how hard we try to change, no matter how much we want to change, we will not be able to do it if our self-concept doesn’t change with us.

That is why it is so important to change our identity as we change our behavior. Rather than just setting a goal, envision the type of person you want to be. And then ask yourself, what would that person do in my situation? And then take that action. What would a fit person do? They would work out often. They would eat healthier. And as you do those things, you will start to forge a new identity. A fit person would run 5 days a week. I run five days a week. Therefore I am a fit person. And eventually it will be hard *not* to work out. Because working out is congruent with your identity as a fit person. Notice too that a fit person wouldn’t kill themselves working out. They wouldn’t work out every day even if they were sore. They wouldn’t have to be a certain weight at a certain time. A fit person just has different habits from an unhealthy person. So the best way to create lasting change is to ask yourself what would the person I want to be do? Then do that thing and congratulate yourself on coming 1% closer to becoming that person.",False,False,selfhelp,172414,Top,2020,5,Low,1,46,2745,positive,positive,False,False,1,1,0

I'm lost in life and don't know what to do,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I turned 18 years old. And I feel completely lost in my life. I don't know what to do. 

I want that one think that I can grind on and I'll love it and it will help me achieve my dreams but I don't know what that thing is. In a simple way, I lack purpose.

I see all these people that have their purpose in life and work hard every day, they grind and they're achieving their goals, and fucking love what they do. All the football players, basketball players, guys that do some martial arts, even some YouTubers. Personally I know a guy that makes music beats and he actually is making a good progress. They all just have something they love and they grind 24/7.

I don't have that thing. I don't have anything to work on and I feel so lost. I have that energy, I want to grind on something but simply don't know what it is. I don't have my dream sport that I wanna be a pro in, any dream job and stuff like that. I wanna be successful in life, I wanna make a very good money, I wanna do something great with my life, I'd say that I'm very ambitious but just dont have purpose.


And because of this my social life struggles I bit too. Don't get me wrong, I got friends, I'm not like some awkward dude but I think it lacks a bit. And the part of it is that I don't talk to girls too. I don't have that much confidence even that I'm trying to work on it. I see my friends getting into a relationships and enjoying their time with girls and I just don't have that. And I got huge fear of missing out on it. I wanna learn to approach girls and talk to them but simply I don't got balls hah. I'm pretty good looking, I take care of myself, I workout, I'd say I'm not awkward but still don't have enough confidence. I feel like if I'll date some girl she'll think that I'm a looser and I don't have any purpose and nothing going for myself.

I'm in highschool now. Problem is that in my school there's 99% guys. No girls at all. For these couple years I saw a few girls in school, I'm not kidding. And because of this I don't have any other option but get to know random people. My friends got girls in school, and in their classes so they talk to them. I don't wanna make excuses but maybe it's sounds like it (or maybe I'm actually making excuses LOL) but they can meet girls easily while I don't even see them cuz there aren't any in my school. Earlier in life I talked to girls and hang out with them and it wasn't a problem. But since I got in this school I feel like everything started getting a bit worse.

Hi r/socialanxiety! My name is Stephanie and in the past months I have developed and designed a social card game to help you better get to know others. I have put a lot of love in it and I would appreciate it so much if you could check it out and tell me what you think about it!,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"What is it about?

Since I am an adult I have realized that making new friends or even getting to know others better has become very difficult. Whenever I meet people we have one of those run-of-the-mill conversations and my face wants to fall asleep. But also with friends I already have - how good do I even know them? I know where they live, where they work, I know about their hobbies etc. but what about their fears and wishes in life? Do I know about their most embarrassing story or what they would change about their life if they could? Matter of fact I don't know these things about people and wanted to change that!

How does it work?

Mate Cards is a set of poker cards that contain 4 different types of questions that can be found on each of the cards symbols. Some questions are easy and fun to answer, some are ice breakers, some will give away certain traits, some will reveal funny stories, some will let you remember and dwell in your past and some might just reveal beautiful forgotten memories.

1. Play. You can play a normal game of cards with your friends with Mate.

2. Ask. When you're getting bored - start asking each other the questions on the cards. Therefore simply pick one card after another. If you're unsure about which questions you want to talk about you can preselect the questions according to the symbols on the cards. Hearts contain broad topics; Diamonds require you to fill in a sentence; Clubs contain ""Have you ever"" Questions and Spades are about choosing between X or Y. Additionally the Jokers include 3 fun drinking games which you can use for that one day you really wanted to play a drinking game but just couldn't think of one.

3. Mate. After playing and asking a round of fun and interesting questions you will see that you have better got to known the others. And who knows where that might lead to!

When do you know a therapist has crossed a line vs just made a mistake?,2,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Hello,

I just had a traumatic experience with my therapist who, for the most part, I like.

I am sorry that I have to be so vague, I just don't feel comfortable going into too much detail: It involved them pushing me to do something (in my life) that is very sensitive and triggering. I tried to explain to them over and over why I don't feel comfortable doing this thing and why I don't feel it is necessary, but they continued to push it.

I did tell my therapist it was triggering during the session. After, I emailed them and told them they crossed the line with me and they apologized. The issue is that I'm paranoid they were trying to make a point or insinuate something negative about me that suggests they don't trust certain things I'm telling them. This is all me making an assumption and based on my own trauma but I feel so uncomfortable with them that I'm not sure about doing another session.

Can anyone here give me examples of when your therapist truly crossed the line or when it was a misunderstanding?",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55680,Hot,2024,1,Very high,1,71,1023,negative,negative,False,False,0,1,0

Am I the bad guy?,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"About 8 months ago I was in a relationship with this girl. We dated for 3 months. The relationship was messy and unstable due to both our mental health and her past and family. But when we were together we were happy. We used to be very close but we didn't know eachother very well when we first got together, it was slightly rushed. Now we are strangers. I kept trying to fight for our relationship   for her but she never fought back. Suddenly one day she gave up on everything including herself and our relationship was over. I never got a reason, she told me that she didn't want to hurt me and that she couldn't handle a relationship.  At first I was in denial and couldn't accept it, I kept pushing for a reason for her to just open up and tell me what was going on. But i never got a response because she never trusted me as much as I did her. She walked away and just stopped caring. I was devastated.  She was going through so much so I gave up and just stayed by her side. It only made the pain worse for me. I just didn't know what she was going through because she kept me in the dark. Now I feel guilty for begging for an answer because i never wanted her to feel forced to open up but communication and trust just meant so much to me. She gave me a reason but she never explained just exactly what was going on. It feels humiliating that she could never be vulnerable with me. She keeps telling me its all her fault and it has nothing to do with me. She thought I expected her to be perfect but I just wanted to stay in her life. But I guess even though I wanted to stay it was killing me to not know what was happening in her life after she used to treat me with so much importance and tell me before. I was okay with not knowing for a while but to see her in pain and falling apart and not know why it was all happening just broke me. I still feel guilty, I feel like I hurt her by asking for too much, for being too assertive and demanding, for making her feel like she couldn't be mentally ill. I just wanted her to be okay, but I have painted myself to be the bad guy. So am I the bad guy? I have apologised so much to her befire for ever making her feel forced or pressured and I have tried to make her understand that I just needed her to be honest, I didnt even need her to date me or focus on my happiness. But she never understood this. She always thought I was forcing her, even though she has told me deep down she wanted me but she couldn't allow herself because she was mentally ill and she didn't want me to know who she truly was. I feel like I have hurt her. She hurt my feelings so many times after the break up with her words and actions. She completely changed and she made me feel like trash for grieving her. I felt like my feelings were a burden and that I talked too much. I could have been lighter and brighter but I feel that I have left her mire scarred. I don't know if Im gaslighting myself or if im overthinking her words but...i feel guilty and i cant stop. i want to apologise to her a hundred times even though i would end up looking like a darn fool. she always denies that i hurt her, she always claims that i was good to her and she was the problem, but why cant i see it that way?",False,False,mentalillness,149341,Hot,2024,2,Very low,0,17,3231,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I've been ""teaching myself"" for a while now. So now it's time I shared with you.

Back in high school I used to be pretty depressed about my social situation. I was always a shy guy, no girlfriends until senior year. Played video games 8 hours a day. Had bad acne. Tried a lot of drugs. Drank. It was some shit...

I did keep a positive attitude (as much as I could) and gradually things changed. Mostly when I *decided for myself* to change.

Now, at 24 years old, I am abundantly successful, work for myself, have complete freedom, have a rich personal love, am confident, have incredible drive, motivation, and inspiration.

So I am putting everything into a book. Because books are the best way to share experience. Because if I help 1 person who was like me, and steer them towards the incredible confidence and abundance I have now, then it will be worth writing.

Working with illegal immigrants,0,False,False,True,False,3,False,"My new reality: I've been working at my trade, building furniture grade custom cabinetry for nearly thirty years. I've become proficient at turning out top grade, unique, serviceable cabinets that will last a lifetime. I shut down the shop that I had built after realizing the demands of the administrative aspect of the business was taking away from the pleasure I was getting doing the actual designing and building of the cabinets. I was presented with an opportunity to help a friend of mine open his own shop, with the stipulation that I would have zero administrative duties, which allowed me to do what I truly love doing, building beautiful cabinets, doing woodwork instead of paperwork, PR work, expediting, blahblahblah, a great arrangement. Success! With the increasing demand for our product, it became necessary to hire and train more help. Good craftsmen, with the desire and intellect to become increasingly skilled and proficient at what we do, are rare. But, through trial and error, sifting through the number of people who came through our shop, we put together a small team of guys with skills, who were reliable and who had a desire to become better and better at what we do. Wages are not really an issue, pay is merit based: the more skills, aptitude, attitude, reliability and value to the company, the higher the wages. Incentives based on quality, productivity, and constant improvement. Success! Now, my boss recently bought in to another cabinet shop, with fourteen employees. I now work at a cabinet manufacturing facility. The work force consists of myself and the two guys who came with me from the original shop, three guys who've, pretty much, had the same type of, if not as much, experience as myself, and eleven guys, with limited skills and low standards of quality who don't speak English, are in this country illegally, and have been for years, whose desire to excel in this trade is not evident. The attitude from some of these guys is: show up, do as little as you can and get away with it! Go home. And now all of a sudden, wages ARE a factor. The boss says he has GOT to retain the low wage earners to remain competitive in the market. Two problems right off the bat: 1) lower quality, which means the reputation we worked so hard to get is suffering a serious blow and 2) a work place that I am no longer looking forward to going to. Communication is difficult, at best. Hostility, distrust, contempt, and a tension that is not conducive to us doing what I love doing, creating beauty for appreciative clients, the primary reason that this effort has been successful. I hate to think that I'm a snob, or a racist, or a Hispanaphobe , but, daily, I watch substandard, shoddy craftsmanship tearing down the reputation that we have worked hard to get. This is my new reality. The options I have suck. I could just watch it deteriorate. Unacceptable. I can keep bringing up the problems I see to the boss. Amplifies and expands the problems, creates even more hostility. I could quit. Unfair to my family, my boss and myself. Economically unfeasable. I could do what I feel is the law-abiding thing to do, my duty as a citizen, and report these illegal immigrants to the authorities, at which point I would be risking the potential destruction of the company that I've worked hard to make succeed, I would be ending a great relationship with a friend that I've been calling my boss, I would be endangering the jobs of my coworkers, who share the same desires for excellence that I have, I would be placing hardship on my family. I'm really uncertain at this point, what the ""right"" thing to do is. I'm really enraged that the lax immigration enforcement policies of the government have put me in this position. Allowing unskilled, illegal workers into various fields in the construction industry, driving the wages down, driving the quality of the finished product down, forcing the highly skilled, higher wage, American workers, out of their trades into trying to find a different job with an income that they had worked hard to attain, and fewer and fewer youngsters find going into the construction trades attractive anymore, because of the lowering of wages forced by the influx of semiskilled, low wage, low quality workers. My situation, I believe, is just one of many more across the country. I can't just do nothing. I just have to rationalize my thoughts without allowing the emotional outrage to taint the picture of what must be done. But I will be doing something. Too many people are just accepting these situations as the new norm. I'm not one of them. I'm angry that politicians don't care what negative consequences their lust for votes causes to their constituents. It's seems like they want businesses to fail so more people will be out of a job and will require government assistance. Me, I just want to go to work, make beautiful stuff that I can be proud of, and go home safely to my family at the end of the day. To do that I will have to turn a blind eye to what I see going on around me. To do that I would have to lie to myself which I will not do. So, we'll see what shakes out. Peace.

She and I both teeter the line of depression and sometimes, I find myself unable to understand her. My depression comes out in bursts and tears and when it's happening, it's easy to see and hear and feel. For her, I think it's something different. She told me this article really put her feelings into words and made her feel like someone else understood and that someone else was facing the same feelings she was.

I wanted to share it here so that others could see it and maybe be comforted by those words as well.

Wtf am I even doing anymore?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I (32M) am completely overwhelmed and defeated by the state of almost everything in my life. 

Just two years ago, I had my own house, a job that paid me enough to live comfortably, was only responsible for myself. Lots of friends, freedom and low stress. A partner that made my life so fun, we shared many passions and complimented each other incredibly well. I worked very hard to get myself to that point as the previous 4 years were fucking terrible. 

I now live in an absolute shit hole, with a family that isn’t mine, no matter how much I want them to be. I married a woman I left my ex for. She convinced my ex was immature and selfish. (7 year age difference with the ex) only to be manipulated into cutting off contact with all of my friends, moving in with my now wife and her kids, in a place where I knew nobody else really. 

I’ve tried to build a life here. I hate it, this town is very small, there’s no variety, no culture, not even so much as a decent place to get breakfast much less dinner. I have to work close to home because the vehicle I drive is a beater. (I let my wife drive my fully loaded SUV I make payments on) because it’s the family car. Yet she also works 5 minutes from our shitty house. 

I feel like I live in the shadow of my wife’s ex. She has two kids with two different men. Her oldest dad isn’t in the picture as he’s a deadbeat addict and criminal. Her youngest’s dad was the man of the family. He was a great dad but a shit partner. My wife left him, and pretty soon after aggressively went after me. (We worked together) he’s since passed. So me and my wife are all these kids have… and I don’t know how to be a dad. I’ve always had trouble connecting to people, kids especially. I’m not energetic or fun. I do however support them in any way that I can. I watch them most of the time because my wife works 2nd shift and I work 1st. They are very indifferent towards me. The oldest even goes out of her way to say things like “I forgot about you” at the holidays, anytime I go to school events or anything like that. I feel like the kids think I broke up their family. My wife always refers to her ex as “My kids dad” even on social media, in posts and stuff, because in all honesty he was. It just makes me feel like an outsider in “our home” which is the same house she and the ex shared. 

My wife is a terrible parent. (She’s exactly as good as she knows how to be) Her kids have absolutely no structure, no respect, no accountability and honestly almost no redeeming qualities. The youngest is your typical iPad kid (7F) she has no patience of any kind. Probably undiagnosed ADHD, and is completely spoiled rotten. My wife is a recovering alcoholic and made up for not being present with material things. To her credit she is pretty smart and does great in school. I try to provide the structure and accountability she’s never had, but she hates me for it. 

The oldest is a little delinquent. (11F) she’s gotten in fights, stolen from other kids at school, has no respect for adults or authority. Intentionally says the most hurtful things to anyone around anytime she doesn’t get her way or is criticized in anyway. I’m afraid she’s going to grow up to be a criminal, or similar type of degenerate. I try really hard with her because I was similarly angry and hurt growing up, so I understand where she’s coming from. Sometimes leveling with her works, usually it doesn’t and she just acts like you’re not worth even breathing the same oxygen as her. 

We are in a crippling amount of debt, which my wife refuses to file bankruptcy on, because it will tank our credit. (We were both over 700 pre 2021) I got sick and couldn’t work for a while and trying to survive on one income destroyed us financially. 

My wife doesn’t treat me like a priority or really act like she wants anything to do with me. I’m very much in love with her. She has a lot of good traits, intangible qualities of being a great person. She’s just been through so much and trying to rebuild her life sober is proving more of a challenge than I think she was prepared for. She has tons of baggage from mental health issues, to family issues. It’s a lot to try to juggle. I have expressed many times that I could use attention / affection. Really it’s the only thing I crave. I do so much to try to support her, the kids and trying to stay positive and strong while we rebuild. 

She chalks a lot of it up to her mental health. I understand. I’ve had many low points in life. 

I’ve never felt as much like giving up as I do now. I’m struggling every day to keep going.

Taboo “it will get better”,4,False,False,True,True,14,False,"I got kicked out of r/depressed and r/suicidewatch because I commented on someone’s post that things will get better and suffering is temporary. 

There’s a taboo around telling someone “things will get better”. I don’t understand why. I understand that it can get old when it feels like there’s no end and you get told things will get better. But it’s true.

As someone who has been depressed for a long time, there was a period of time where things were a lot better, I was in love and not only my depression but also my eating disorder and social anxiety improved. Things unfortunately got worse again after we broke up and my mother got diagnosed with lymphoma. But what I am trying to say is, THINGS CAN GET BETTER. 

I feel sad about being kicked out of the other subreddits, I think it’s rude to kick out someone who is already depressed, I had no bad intentions and I really needed that support. They could have just kicked me out of the one where I commented that, but I got kicked from both even though I had not even interacted with r/suicidewatch (they have the same mods). What was I supposed to say? “Yes nothing will get better, your suffering will never end.”?

I quote this from r/suicidewatch rules:

d) “Please never make promises to vulnerable OP’s that you personally can’t keep. This means not saying “it gets better” or guaranteeing any outcomes! It also means not to make any supportive but unverifiable assertions about the OP, i.e. telling them they’re a good/strong/etc. person.

I also had peed my bed a lot and had nightmares and she yelled at me and made me clean my bed and go back to sleep and school the next day.

But sitting inside every day, in pain... there is nothing to motivate me.
I can't work.
I got an invitation to a spa, I went. I felt terrible. What should be regulating me was causing me pain and my social anxiety was strong.
My body reacts to everything with pain. How could I work?
It's a vicious circle.
We have no money for food. I don't go anywhere. I can't work.
My whole 10s and 20s are gone... 30s will be the same, if I live to see it.
So what's the point?
I'd love life. But my nervous system is taking everything away from me.
Constant pain. Anxiety. Depression. All my friendships have broken up.
I was working, I was fired. Barely a student job.

Not being able to do anything while I watch my life rotting away,45,False,False,True,False,19,False,"I (19f) feel like ending my life. I have severe social anxiety to the point that I cannot even make eye contact with anyone let alone talk to them. I am in second year of my university and I feel like a loser. I never participate in any extracurricular activities and even if I decide to participate, when the day to participate comes, I back out because I feel anxious. Whenever a professor asks something I go blank, nothings comes up in my mind. I am so overwhelmed by my anxiety that I am not even able to form any thoughts or ideas. I come off as a rude and arrogant person because of my social anxiety. I am honestly so tired of being anxious. Nobody even takes social anxiety seriously, everyone thinks that it is just shyness so I can't even share with anyone how I feel.
Last year I met a guy online and we started talking and the conversation went really well but he suddenly stopped responding so I texted him what the reason was and if he was ok or not but he replied only after a month had passed and told me that something had happened to him that made him feel like shit, so I resumed talking to him. We again started talking and it went well but then again he stopped responding and hasn't responded since then. It's been more than a month and I haven't texted him asking for a reason. I had always been a lonely person ever since my social anxiety started. When I talked to that guy i felt a little less lonely. Now that he has ghosted me I can't help but feel lonely all over again. I mean if u don't want to continue talking just say so. I hate being kept in the dark and not knowing the reason for something especially when I'm involved. I want to ask him what the reason is but I feel like it's not worth it. He had already ghosted me once and I don't want to go around asking him why he hasn't responded to me again. If he wanted to talk he would have but I can't deny the fact that I feel extremely lonely. It doesn't help the fact that all my friends are in one university and I'm in a completely different one. They all see each other almost everyday and I'm in my dorm all alone. It was my birthday a few days back and one of my friends forgot to wish me. She forgot my birthday last year too. I don't know how to feel about this. I want to get mad but I feel like I am overreacting and it's just a birthday. I also don't have the energy to fight and argue. 
I know that I need to go out, face my fears and challenge myself but I cannot bring myself to do that. I really cannot. 
I have been told my multiple professors that I'm extremely quiet and whenever they say such things I feel like something is wrong with me.

We got back together after I graduated college, and a month later, I had a mental break. No one was hurt, but I basically stalked her into blocking me on everything. If somehow she's reading this, please know how sorry I am. I feel so horrible that my actions made you feel unsafe and forced you to do that. I'm so sorry that I wasn't strong enough to be better to you. I lost a good friend over that, and it's my fault.

It's been about a year now and I can't seem to forgive myself over this. I feel like if I could truly apologize to her, and thus hear her personally forgive me, that might change things. But I won't get that, I lost the ability to do that after I creeped her out. My friends that talked to her in the aftermath said she doesn't seem to think I'm horrible.

Our bodies emit spiritual energy as heat.,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"The physical body has meridians that run through it. Chinese knew about this for five thousand years. Western Medical Science denied that meridians in the body, acupuncture meridians, existed.

According to Chinese philosophy, these meridians were channels through the body in which energy flowed. They call this chi energy. 

In India, it's called Prana energy. 

This has been known for thousands of years throughout the world. But Western Medical Science has denied that this existed, they said it's a myth and that there's no biological evidence that any channels exist in the body and that anything called Energy, flows through these channels.

Until about 20 years ago when a new technology was developed that actually showed heat moving in the body through these exact Meridian channels. This can be easily seen with a thermal infrared camera and is called your Aura by spiritual practitioners.

If you've ever gotten goosebumps from reading, singing, watching/hearing something that touches your spirit or while thinking about a loved one, you activated this spiritual energy.

After Chi and Prana It goes by many different names like:                                                                 Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Kriyas, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more.

F*** a title. (Poem),4,False,False,True,False,0,False,"

I’m tired of screaming to the sky, 

Asking just to fly, 

And wishing I could cry, 

Begging anything above just to help, 

To give me a sense of self, 

Something to make me whole

Something to heal my soul. 

I’ve tried the pills,

And used their skills, 

Which sent me into psychosis. 

I wish there was a hypnosis, 

I’ve begged all the God’s, 

Cried to all the priests, 

Asked all the doctors, 

Yet nobody has a clue

Just what’s wrong with me. 

I wanna cry, 

Or spread my wings and fly, 

But instead I laugh, 

Maniacal and lost

Within the crevices of my mind.  

I’m like a fallen angel, 

Strapped with a mini-gun

And lost within a battlefield;

I see my fallen foes, 

Ones I tried to help, 

Yet only harmed. 

I’m laughing as this heaven

Burns to the ground, 

Shattering glass and exploding grenades

A cacophonous symphony

Thats playing out my death

All the while I laugh, 

Because I can’t cry, 

Even when I saw the tears, 

And heard their fears. 

Tears never fell, 

From my empty heart of stone,

No matter how much the whips in my mind stung

I still never once cried;

But instead I laughed.

Is PTSD from sexual trauma different from other causes of PTSD?,3,True,False,True,False,31,False,"I have PTSD from sexual assault, and not to belittle other causes of PTSD, but PTSD from sexual trauma, from my intuition, seems to must be very different from other causes of PTSD, since it destroys someone's integrity to the most extreme way. For me, I get tension in the genitals, loss of confidence, trouble concentrating, and extreme feelings of horror/anxiety whenever anything remotely sexual comes across my eyes or mind. 

There are worse horrors, such as losing body parts in combat, but I'm just saying that PTSD from sexual trauma tears someone's sense of self in such an extreme way that it has to be so different from other causes of PTSD, especially if it is from incest or something like that. what do you think? 

ETA: many people here really aren't that bright. Why in the world would i want to compete in "" my trauma is worse than yours"". If anything, i'd feel better if my trauma were less traumatizing in comparison. I want to know about the mechanism of PTSD that is caused by sexual trauma.

I don't know who i am or what i want to do,2,False,False,True,False,6,False,"Feeling a lost, like I'm stuck in a life I didn't quite build for myself. It's like every time I think I'm past the rough patches, another wave comes crashing down. I feel like I'm drowning.

Growing up, my parents were loving but super protective (helicopter parents). Being an only child didn't exactly help either. ""No"" was practically my middle name. Now, looking back, I wonder how much of what I am is actually me, and how much was influenced by all that hovering.

College was...interesting. Met this guy (admittedly a jerk) but back then, he was my world. The relationship was a challenge but my mother made it worse as she was always accusing him of cheating (no proof, just her ""feelings""). And because she wanted me to break up with him she dropped this adoption bomb on me, saying ""your life was a miracle, your mother didn't want you and was supposed to abort you but here you are with us - you are worth more than your trashy bf so break with him"". After this, I felt numb for a few years. I felt like I was living life through auto-pilot.

My career path was another thing. Med school was the family expectation. I liked the idea, but I wasn't sure if it was ME wanting it, or just everyone else. Them hovering around me and always ""helping"" also contributed to my incredible insecurity. People's insults could do me no harm honestly because I could give them to myself just fine. Even when I said I could handle things, they swooped in and would also tell me they just ""wanted to help"". I told them off before but they even got mad at me asking my I can't just accept their help and made me feel like an ungrateful bitch. I ended up with a different degree, closer to my actual interests, but I realized later I was not happy with it. I didn't even attend my graduation ceremony because I honestly was not my best self during college and was merely functioning on autopilot. Fast forward, I met my husband, had a beautiful son. But last year was when my realizations really hit me. This life I built, it wasn't the one I dreamed of. Living solo, exploring new places, maybe even that med school dream I buried – all these things started calling my name. But then reality slaps me in the face: family, responsibility, a tiny human who depends on me. I love my son more than anything in the world, but sometimes I can't help but think, ""What if I waited?"" My husband even calls me ""dependent"" when I ask what he thinks of me as a person. I usually feel that he would describe me as someone indecisive, someone he can't trust to do things. If people ask, he can't even say I'm smart. Thanks to motherhood, I'm also no longer beautiful. So what am I? Who am I even? That strong, independent woman I wanted to be just feels like a distant mirage. I stated a lot of things about my parents but somehow I can't even blame them now because I'm an adult. Their actions may have contributed to who I am but my choices led me here. I wish I made better choices. I wish I could go back in time armed with my current knowledge and realization and just redo my life.

I’m extremely tired,3,False,False,True,False,0,False,"TW**

I’m 20F. At around 5 years of age I was raped by a close relative of mines. I was also pressured to do sexual acts by others. When you’re that young you usually don’t realise how wrong these things are, it wasn’t until I was a bit older that I learnt how messed up it all was. Unfortunately that wasn’t the end of it, at age 12ish I was also molested by a family friend. I’ve never told anyone until now, due to the fact that there’s no one out there that I know who would truly understand. I’m too ashamed to share.

During my school years I had extreme body issues (I still do). I was overweight and never liked how I looked. I was constantly picked on by boys. I never was pretty or skinny like all the other girls. I would laugh along when jokes were thrown at me, but deep inside I was hurt. Unfortunately the jokes didn’t stop at school, my looks were also criticised at home too.

My parents were abusive verbally and physically towards me, especially during my adolescence. I would get bad beatings, sometimes thrown on the ground until my nose bled. Hair pulled, slapped, scratched and punched. You name it. And then a few minutes later I would be hit with the “we only do it because we love you”. This cycle of torment really messes your head up. I’ve been critically depressed from as young as I can remember. 

A few years back a close cousin of mine unalived herself. I remember my mother was on the phone with my auntie comforting her, and then she said to me “You can always open up to me”. How ironic. Considering the fact that I did open up to her a few years before that. When I first opened up to my parents and told them how I was suffering from severe depression. Instead of comfort I was ridiculed and yelled at, all because i was feeling the way I was feeling.

I got into an argument with my parents yesterday and as per usual I was yelled at and beaten. I am currently laying on my bed, I’ve been in my room since the altercation and I haven’t eaten at all. It’s 11:34pm here and I’m thinking about my life. I feel hopeless. I’m tired mentally, emotionally, physically even spiritually. I just don’t have anymore strength in me. I’ve been wronged so many times in my life. I’m so close to ending it but truthfully I’m too scared. I’ve been crying nonstop. There’s nothing else for me in this world. I wished I was loved. Genuinely.

PTSD reasons if anyone is curious:

I was violently attacked by a man who stalked me into a public bathroom when I was about 10, I have seen my mother beaten up by neighbors and they broke glass on her head and she bled a lot and she moved away but left me living there with my grandma (it was a shared communal Soviet apartment so I had to hide in the bathroom or room at all times). I was drugged and raped at 17. I've never had a home and I grew up in extreme poverty during Soviet collapse.

I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,920,False,False,True,False,109,False,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful.

Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful.

"What does the voice inside your head sound like? Does it radiate love and kindness, or is it your harshest critic? Let's take a dive into how we can start being kinder to ourselves and what that does for our overall well-being.",197,False,False,True,False,27,False,"You probably clicked this post because you've been suffering from something similar to myself. For as long as I can remember, I've been at war with the bully inside my head. 

It started at a young age, it's claws deeply embedded subconsciously in my psyche. Perhaps it was the high standards exemplified by my parents, maybe a sports coach, my sibling. It may have been a combination of things that resulted in the cultivation of an unhealthy consciousness. Often times when I've had success, or achieved something I was working towards, the celebration is short lived. My mind has this tendency to view success with microscope, analyzing the shortcomings and areas I could have done better. In a healthy mind, this can be very intuitive as it gives you an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Inside my head and others like me, every shortcoming is a dagger, arming my assailant for the lecture to come. 

This has been the reality for a large portion of my life. No matter if I fail or succeed, the voice inside my head will find a reason to remind me that I'm worthless. Only recently have I come to realize that I've been operating from a state of shame. When we operate from a state of shame, in essence, we shut down. Instead of reacting to situations in a neutral way, we respond by taking it personally. This turns into a negative thinking circle that often leads to seclusion and depression. Once depression sinks in, it's a lot harder to get out of that negative thinking state where the bully reigns supreme. 

So what can I do about it? First, start addressing the voice when it becomes hostile with a gentle approach. Breathe deeply, at least 5 breaths. This is going to calm you down and promote rationality. Now, listen to the words that form and with patience tell yourself that it's going to be okay. Next, focus on changing the tone of that voice to something more relaxed. This isn't always easy as our ego likes to try and take over, don't let it. As the words become less hostile, this is an opportunity to talk to yourself with kindness. When I first talked to myself with kindness, instead of the usual ""You always do this!"" I was shocked at my bodies responses both physically and mentally. Instead of getting more uptight at the situation, arms crossed, ultimately shutting down for the day, I started to relax and think more rationally. As that happened I was able to reevaluate the scenario and realize that my ego was in control. Right after calming my ego down, I saw the situation for what it was, completely within my control. This lead to a healthy conclusion and a paradigm shift.

I didn't get to this point without help and I am only at the beginning of my journey to healing. I just wanted to share some insight and a breakthrough I've had on the topic so that it might inspire others to do the same. My main resource and the book that first challenged me to go deeper is called ""The untethered soul"" By Michael Singer. He goes into detail on how to retrain your mind to be one of health and comfort, no matter what life throws at you. Personally, I've been getting back in control of my physical and mental health through Yoga. After researching and experimenting with ways to motivate myself, I find it to be the most all encompassing habit I've taken on. It reminds me to calm down, take it slow, think it through and most of all, be kind to yourself and others. 

Please feel free to share your own stories, successes/failures, journeys to health, thoughts about your inner voice. Community is so important and I would love to have a discussion with this topic as the basis. Let's figure out how to be kinder to ourselves and in turn radiate that kindness back into the world.",False,False,selfhelp,172414,Top,2020,2,Very high,0,227,3721,positive,positive,False,False,1,0,1

Rounded the corner only to get backed into another corner,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"

Just a heads up, this may be a long read. It all depends on how much I decide to get off of my chest. And this may be a difficult for some to read so I understand if you don't.

So I have PTSD due to various abuses suffered throughout my childhood and being in the position where I had to be an adult at 14. My mother was a drug addict, prescription pills. Throughout my teens and mid-20s I pretty much denied I had anything working against me mentally. Despite all that, I denied the fact that I was an absolute insomniac, found myself repeatedly in abusive relationships because I felt for some reason I deserved that. My son's mother and I experienced a very traumatic loss and I eventually had a nervous breakdown. 

I made an attempt on my own life and thankfully failed at it. After that I voluntarily checked myself into the ward and proceeded to start getting the help I so desperately needed. Of course like anything, it was a process. It wasn't an overnight fix and that's for damn certain. During that time period my mom got clean and I had her back for about 4 years before the years of drug abuse caught up to her. After her passing I found a good therapist and I saw her for a little over 3 years. 

I started putting my foot down, stopped allowing myself to be walked on, and did my best to become the best father I could possibly be. This is something I still strive to do. Eventually I would become my grandmother's caretaker because the only other help she has is my developmentally delayed uncle. This brings us to present day. 

January 24th of last year, my cousin was renting out our small apartment over our garage. At some point she had fallen off of the wagon and we were not aware of that. That evening I got a phone call from my 13-year-old cousin, her daughter, and she's absolutely hysterical. Apparently she went upstairs to get things together in order to take a shower before going to bed and she found her mother unresponsive. I got up there, and I could tell she was already gone. But because of the fact that her daughter was there I did my best, cpr, chest compressions, anything to try and attempt to get some sort of a heartbeat or a pulse. Sadly, it was all for not. 

We got the coroner's report a little over 2 weeks ago and the official cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. Now I'm trying my best to get into counseling during this whole thing, and my grandmother ends up having to go into the hospital. She had a bad fall at the start of last year, reinjured her back after an old injury and has been spending time in a wheelchair. My cousin and I got funds together and got her a better one. She used it for less than 48 hours and her back started giving her hell. So much in fact that she actually asked us to take her to the hospital. 

Today I got a phone call from the doctor and he's telling me she's got anywhere from 6 to 18 months to live. She's experiencing heart failure. I don't know what to do. She's been my rock, my one consistent relative I could always depend on when things got hard. Yes, she is an 86 year old type 2 diabetic, the doctors were thinking open heart surgery but they feel as if it is too risky, she's not a good candidate for stents. At this point I'm just trying to help her get her affairs in order. 

I'm 42, and I am so f****** scared. I'm trying to stay strong so my kids don't see me lose it. My 10 year old son is incredibly close to her, he's on the spectrum and more often than not she's one of the few people that can get through to him when he's having an episode. His 5 year old brother would make it a point every morning to say good morning and tell her he loves her before going off to school. And she was always the first person he ran to when he got in the door.

On Friday I was going to see a friend and we decided to go on a strip club because I’ve never been on one.

We both started getting dances from two beautiful ladies which was $150 each, then they asked us if we wanted a VIP dance for $600 each.

This was obviously too much and it was not worth it and somehow they also made me spend 400 more. 

My friend will pay me back $750 because the last 400 was me getting scammed and I said I’ll stand for that.

Why would a girl do like this?,5,False,False,True,False,1,False,"So there's a girl in my class. She and her friends know me by my name, I have overheard them a few times that's why I know. We also had eye contact a few times and often I noticed that she tried to get near to me physically like she wanted me to chat with her. Based on my past experiences wirh girls, I'm certain she has/had a crush on me. A few days ago she approached me along with one of her friends and called me out by my name, we had a short 1 min talk about courses and then I left. She was friendly and polite. A week later I came across her, she saw me as well, I said HEY and she completely ignored me. Like she didn't even bother to look at me much less say anything in reply. A day later I saw her coming and again she saw me as well but she just took a turn and went in another direction. After that, I noticed that she would only stare at me from afar and make eye contact, this happened twice.

Every girl is the same!,0,True,False,True,False,8,False,"Every girl is the same, they all want one thing only, money. A guy with the fucking Audi (or equivalent), and a lot of money in his pocket. It doesnt matter if you are ugly, if you have money she will be with you. They all say they care about love, and all that, but they lie, they are all the same, only care about money. I tought that she was special when I met her, but she is probably same as every one else. So good luck, every rich born has bigger chances of having a girl then normal guys (poor ones), fuc. you all.

EDIT: I was pissed of, well mostly because of the situation Im in so, I didnt give enough explanation. I didnt know was it 3 or 15 oclock ...at that time, somewhere around february...she did catch cold.....nonsense ignore it.


I never had a girl (friend) either of those, mostly because I was always focused on my carrer, so I didnt have enough time to go out, or even hang out with friends, because I was always shy......basically Im that guy in class you dont talk to unless you have to, and you avoid him, just because he maybe doesnt care about looks or anything else, he just cares about his objective, and when he completes it, he instantly moves on another one, he cant enjoy like most of the people can, because he always thinks that whatever he does thats not sufficent, but I mean he cares about his friends and everyone, but he will never show it. And so he finished high school, went to university, and thats where shi. starts happening. He notices that one girl in the class, and he thinks about her, all the time, he can study, he finishes some pretty hard exames while 80% rest of the class failes them. But he doesnt care, only thing he cares about is her. Why, you ask. I dont know. Why do I care so much about someone that I dont even know (I jumped to conclusion that she is the same as the others, but I dont want to think like that about her, because I dont know her, but your mind can and will play games with you, I know that). Before I met her, I was....like everyone else in their 18/19s, played a lot of video games, a lot, over 10 years of video games under my belt, ps1 (crash bandicot, bugs bunny great games ), ps2 (f1 06, vice city, san andreas), ps3 (gta v, mw3 especially when on first year of university - you know professors iritate you, so when you get home, you turn on mw3 and you express your anger in multiplayer, those were the days). But that took some part of me, I was never good in social situations, talking with other people was impossible, i never felt safe wherever I went, I just wanted to go back home, sit in front of the tv and play. Maybe thats the reason why I m in a fuc.ed situation now. But I know that when I met that person in class, weeks were passing by, and I never quite understand that, I tought that, "" o she looks great, i like the way she looks"" ""wow, she is smart, i like that"" , I didnt notice on time signes that Im falling in Love with someone, because I never knew that feeling, you know. When I recall now: beautiful dark brown bob hair on her, at least thats what she looked like when i saw her for the first time back in 2012. I remember at first I hated that particular university, I hated going there, every day, every freakin day, but later on, I went there just to saw here, it was strange, Its strange even now, when I think about it, about this situation, I could never think that something like that could happen to me. For me she is the most beautiful girl in whole time and space, I know there are others, but I just want her, no one else. Most fascinating thing is, that there is a possibility that the same chemistry teacher teached me when I was in junior school (1-2) years before high school, for one year and then that teacher moved to different city, to different high school and teached her (that girl i saw on first year of university, the one im talking about in this text) in her school 2-3 years later (after it teached me). Thats incredible. Unfortunatley she is probably with someone who doesnt deserve her, respect her, but no matter what I will love her unconditionally, because she is something special, really is.

A lot of time passed, and I decided to call her, but due to my lack of courage and all those things that go with it, low self esteem, voice inside of my head, and general bad opinion about myself, I screwed up with that one phone call. I mean we never talked, we dont know each other, but I like her, I love her for gods sake, why, how, I dont Understand, and  I dont know. My biggest concern is not that she will reject me, no, my biggest concern is that I ll never be able to tell her that she changed my life, the way I do things, the way I look on others now. I dont play video games anymore, and I take care of my self more then ever, because of her, I always dress best I can, wherever I go, because subconsciously I think what if I see her somewhere, I want to look best I can for her. I planed on calling her for the second time, to tell her all this, to tell her that I ll love her no matter what till the end of my life, but Im afraid that I ll never be able to do it. Biggest fear is that I ll woke up someday in a hospital, and the doctors will tell me, something like easy sir, in your ages every movement can be critical, and then i ask what ages I m 22 for gods sake, then they say, no, sir you are 80 years old, thats my biggest fear that I ll find myself in a situation like that, that time will pass by like a train, but I will still want to call her and tell her I love her, unfortunately it will be too late then, but even then I wont be able to do it, unfortunatley.
Right, need to go back to explain things.
An a moment of anger I wrote that every girl is the same, of course they arent, but most of them are. I cant buy her expensive gifts, diners, skiing, or something else, the only thing I can give her is my life, but of course thats not important today. So there you have it, full story. Dont make mistakes I did, if you like someone, if you think you love them, give it a go, right that moment, right that time. For me, its over, I m already 80 years old, even thou Im just 22, but I already regret for things I missed. A lot of people I see around here have problems, we all have for someone this could be a walk in the part to do something like this, but to me it isnt, my entire life people were good to me, but then long time ago something went wrong, i dont know what, or when, but i know that when i think about her, i smile, and sometimes I could even motivate myself to do some things, but then voice kicks in and says things like, ""what do you want, why would she be with a guy like you, you are poor, you will die on street"" and then I sometimes just....go crazy, and hate myself. I was normal long time ago....I dont know if ill ever get better or be able to do something out of my self. I live in a so-so family, they say they love me and all, they see I m sad and they ask what is it, but I never tell them. Its not just about that one girl, its about many other things in my life, but she was that one thing because i wrote this.

I m sorry younger me, I betrayed you, you could be someone but....I didnt know better, I never understood people around me, i always tought that my life is a mistake, probably is, but...Im sorry, if it means something to you.

Any idea on what this was? Too many thoughts/desensitized to everything/obsession with useless things,1,True,False,True,False,1,False,"I am currently 18, and I had quite a strange experience when I was 11-13 and I still don't know what it was.
So basically there was this period in which I had too many thoughts. I remember standing in the bathroom for half an hour while the shower was running with a bunch of thoughts, another characteristic was that I always had to finish it, that's what was causing the delay. It was very annoying. i also have ocd btw, so sometimes i couldnt start a new activity before finishing these thoughts.
i still have ocd but i dont have this thing of finishing the thoughts taking hours/an abundance of thoughts.
so the thoughts, they just kept coming. i cant even describe it anymore. i just remember not being ablet os leep because there were so many thoughts, calling my mom during break because i couldnt stop thinking and it was distressing me. i dont remember much except for fragments like me being in art class and asking my friends all these weird questions of life, i remember they didn't really understand me and i felt frustrated. but it wasnt like ""oh whats life in the philosophical sense"", it was more like why the hell are we here i dont understand my consciousness how can you do these trivial tasks without having these thoughts?! what are you doing. I thought they were the crazy ones.


i also remember having a very strange moment in which i felt like i had taken over the old me, like i was a bad me. i also had all these dreams about demons and woke up in fear once. and i kept thinking i had a bad spirit in me -  it was very strange.
ok i still feel like i didnt describe the abundance of thoughts well. its not like youre thinking a lot in yourself after a long day. its like you cannot do anything else because they keep being there, and also NEW ones keep popping up at every loose string. so for example my thoughts would actually keep going off on a tangent, in a way that just wouldnt happen now, or for you guys. like oh there was this book - 10 mins of thinking about this one thing...  and then coming back to the main thought.
also another thing was that I had to recall exactly how i came on a certain thought.
another thing was that i was afraid that if i didnt have a certain thought/do a certain thing it would change how events would be. 
another thing was that, i remember this before the ""storm"" broke out, it was summer and i movd around the house while watching a show or something and i started telling myself i had to recall eexactly where i was in what order. i was even asking my mother repeatedly where i was just before just to make sure that the order was correct. it was VERY strange.
i think this is when it started since, although i still have to perform rituals/remember stuff daily, this was much more obsessive, it was all-consuming, literally i felt like that was my only goal, to retreive those steps. it was almost as if it was haunting me.
Ok last but not least: in that period ifelt disconnected form my parents, i kept thinking why do i love them? theyre just arbitrary people. I also felt like nothing pleased me anymore, even eating pasta or watching a movie or something! everything felt goalless, i kept on trying to find a goal i would eventually like, or something to keep myself busy with/explain why this was happening to me, but i just couldnt.
AND in that period i spoke to some friends, again disconnected to reality (i know this because i said some very very strange things i would never say now as you will see soon): i said stuff like that i was having too much thoughts, like i felt there was a demon in me. A friend told me recently how much I had scared her (this was years ago i wonder why she remember but whatevs): i came up to her at the end of the day, and said ""mary i havent given you a kiss this morning, so give me a kiss"" (we always kiss each other in the morning). and she was really freaked out. so basically this is just ocd right, this ""had"" to be done and wasnt done for the day. except i would NEVER DO something like this now, ie trespass the boundary of involving other people in it.....?
and she said i looked absolutely crazy and not like myself.

ok i think im done now. i just want to know what was this? btw there are some other important details i think i have left out but i have already written a lot. 
for reference, right now im pretty normal. ihave ocd still, but others dont notice it, i love my family (well not rationally but im not desensitized to them), i still have pleasure. im going to study next year.
there was another period in my life, around the time of earthquakes in japan, that was also very strange and much scarier. i actually think i may have mixed up some events. but basically the too much thoughts thing is period I.
ok lol i sound crazy just tell me if you recognize anything,  I would be so glad if someone has had a similar experience.

I am going to die alone!,4,False,False,True,False,6,False,"Venting out : 
I (28F) come from a nuclear family and my dad had been on work trips for most parts, so I was raised majorly by my mom and I have no siblings. My dad was one of the best people on earth and I lost him a few months ago. My mom on the other hand is a good person but she was extremely verbally abusive towards everyone in the family and physically abusive to us and her parents, so I always hated her growing up. I saw my dad getting abused by her my whole life and never knew what I could do to help him so I ended up crying all the time. But, both of them loved me to death.

We have moved a lot geographically so I was never able to have stable group of friends. Finally I went to an all girls college and everyone hated me there as I was this extremely spoiled, daddy's princess who knew nothing in real world and I used to cry in my room all the time, so my life was still pretty fucked up. 

The only escape I ever had was jumping from one relationship to another, I have been doing that since i was 14, so I continued doing that. I threw all my anger at my boyfriends and then would change my relationship when things would get bad. 

Anyhow, my college got over and I got a job and have been working since. This is the only good thing I have, I am financially independent.

I got into this relationship over 2 years ago and things were wonderful in the beginning, except I messed things up by throwing my anger at him but he never left me and I thought hey, now that all my anger is gone I can finally begin to be a healthy relationship but God had other plans. He has started to take revenge and he insults me , hurts me, blames every chance he gets and I have lost every ounce of self respect I ever had. He is a good guy and had made significant sacrifices to be with me, does not have bad habits, nothing questionable. So, I feel that if I let him go, I wouldn't ever get a good guy so I digest all the hatred with a pinch of salt. I do this because I think it's my karma coming back and this is what I deserve.

I have lost my dad a few months ago, then I had a surgery which has an extremely long recovery and one of my closest friends got married and rest of them are all married/ engaged/ pregnant/making alot of money. I am living with my family (due to recovery) and they love me but I think they don't like me as a person and that is true for everyone else in my life too. I do not have friends to reach out to , therapy is too expensive, my boyfriend hates me, can't share all this with my family as my mom is also processing grief. Overall, I am completely alone and super lonely. 

Another thing to know about me is I am an extremely logical person, thrive for perfection in every aspect of my life and generally don't give importance to emotions and now I am overwhelmed to point where I don't know what to do. I know for a fact that this relationship is doomed to fail and I am not cut out to be a wife/mother. I lack empathy and emotional understanding plus I have too much baggage.

I had hobbies when I was a child but since we moved so much geographically I got out of touch and now I have no hobby. My mom also made sure to feed me for my entire life that my friends are bad, my relatives are bad, everyone is out there to hurt me so as an adult I never know how to sustain any friendship and I also have no contact with my relatives because I wasn't allowed to for about 25 years. 

I am a complete loner and all I want is to stay on my bed and use my phone which is really depressing but that's what I like, however, I do make a effort to do a few things during the day. As a result of all of the above, I feel like I am going to die alone.",False,False,depression,1007665,Hot,2024,2,Low,1,24,3684,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I'm improving!!!,9,False,False,True,False,2,False,"A few weeks ago I made a post on here about my realization on self love and self forgiveness and basically accepting that you're gonna make mistakes and blah blah blah

So in line with that I wanted to get closer with my roommates, particularly the one that I share a room with. My first semester I was awkward as fuck with them. I constantly avoided them bc I thought they all hated me FOR that sole reason of being awkward as fuck. I was overthinking safe to say

Skip ahead but these past few weeks me and my roommate have been really close! We're talking more and she's been inviting me to go on her occasional morning walks (she knows I love walking in the afternoon). In fact, we were supposed to go on a morning walk today but we scrapped the idea bc the weather was bad.

Skip ahead, there was an event happening in our dorm hall and me, her, and my other roommates, go to. It was super awkward for me bc I'm not rlly close to the other too but that doesn't matter. After the event, me and her were lowkey hungry so we wanted to go to a restaurant which was pretty far.

So what was meant to be a quick walk to this restaurant turned into a 6 hour night walk around our area!! We were literally walking and talking and exploring but I felt so happy it was great :D

I've been getting out of my comfort zone more and have been becoming a happier person after that self-forgiveness post I made.

Is this ptsd? Drug ptsd,2,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I had a situation happen with drugs in December. I was given a lot of THC accidentally by someone and was told it had an amount that was good for my tolerance. But it was around 175 mg and way too much. My tolerance was like 20-40 mg. I greened out severely and had a panic attack. I was shaking and convulsing for hours, the person had to calm me down and thankfully was there the whole time but also high so they could only do so much. It was very scary. For days after I was extremely paranoid, anxious, couldn’t drive, disassociated and out of it. I was scared of everything and couldn’t be alone. I couldn’t sleep either. This lasted for like two weeks. It then was followed by a major depression, which was prevalent before this occurrence with the THC happening, but it was very bad. But now I’ll have sparks of anxiety out of nowhere and paranoia. Now this is the important part: I have irrational fears surrounding things being laced with drugs. Everytime I eat, my brain is saying don’t eat it, you’ll get high. No matter what it is. If I go to someone’s house and I know someone who lives there does any kind of drug, I’m scared or nervous I’m going to get high from just being there. I’m so scared of this happening.

My brother's basically a dead man walking,8,True,False,True,False,4,False,"I'm writing this post not about me, but about my borther;

For the past 2 years, he's been in and out of psychiatric hospitals 4 times, with 2 suicide attempts on record, and at this point, I really don't know what I can do to help him.

His biggest reasons for wanting to commit suicide is that he feels his life unfulfilling and that he has no friends or girlfriend, but also he doesn't want to commit to a life of work. I think his problem is also rooted in the years of abuse that he suffered under my mother's roof, and the lack of psychiatric attention he got as a child (as the psychiatrists themselves have said.)

My mother is still a problem because she's not well equipped to help my brother at all; being the root of the issue, she is toxic and still somewhat abusive, and our family is definitely not in a position to help him. I'm not sure where else he could go, I don't really know whether we have any family (saner than us) that can welcome him. He can't go to his father's or his cousin's place because of religious differences, and at this point I'm not sure what we can do to help him.

There's not really that much mental hospitals can do either, especially considering he doesn't have the will, unlike I do, to want to change, which makes it even harder since he declines all psychiatric help and refuses to talk to the psychiatrists from the mental hospital. We know what's causing all his issues now but we still pretty much can't do anything about it.

He also distrusts us and refuses our help.

I think the biggest problem is his environment. If he weren't with us, it would be so much easier for him to get back on his feet. Also the screwed up sites he frequents on the internet, but y'know..

I've been feeling EXTREMELY guilty about it because i feel like I'm projecting on my partner when they really, truly don't deserve it. they're the most loving and gentle person I've met and understanding of my symptoms but there's still fear in the back of my head that they will hurt me if i ""misbehave"" and i have nightmares of them hurting me the way i was hurt as a child. i feel very guilty because they would never hurt a fly and have made me feel so safe during the worst episodes.


is this unheard of? getting worse in good relationships? i wish i could ask a therapist but our budget doesn't allow it yet, and I'm scared to talk about it with my partner because they're afraid of Me being scared of them. I'm not sure how to explain that I'm not scared of them, but the behaviors I'm having make me very afraid of anyone in a position of closeness to me, if that makes sense.

I might have had a slight version of anxiety attack yesterday when my parents were fighting over something ( My mom was taking out her anxieties/anger indirectly about me with my father ). My heart started beating first and there was a strange feeling that calmed after hardly 10mins when i hugged my brother and wept. And now since 2AM I woke up twice not knowing what I was feeling again but could feel my mind all over  mixed thoughts and almost same feelings as yesterday. This is my first time waking up like this and I am unsure of what is wrong with me. My parents say its them who are fighting and I should just ignore them at that time but I am unable to.

Triggered by seeing my ex,2,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Sorry if this is not the right place. I just am not sure where might be and looking for advice. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 19 years old (now 28) due to situations I placed myself at uni and living away. I have had therapy on and off for anxiety and depression since and it mainly has really worked supporting me. I honestly believed until recently I didn't have any sort of PTSD. 

Since the age of 21 I have had 4 relationships. 2 really good relationships including the one k am in currently but then 2 propped horrid ones. 
One relationship I was in, I was sexually assaulted and then later found out he was on the sex offenders register. 
The second rubbish relationship he was very clearly a narcissist. Manipulated me to constantly feel like I was worth nothing. Gaslighting me and denying he had a child for a year to only announce he had a child when I said I was going to possibly propose to him. His sister had messed me on face book 2/weeks into our relationships telling me he had a child. I would have been fine if he just told me the truth. Other things like saying how my family and friends hated me and when I final got the balls to break up with him. He told me ""I will just find another rich lady to look after me"" which made me have a true wake up call. 

Anyway, I have been with my current partner for almost 3 years and although both of us have had hard times we are solid as a relationship and as a team. He is aware of I'm intimacy issues sometimes due to the sexual assalt and making sure I don't get triggered by tv shows+ other things. So we are good and I love him to the end of the earth. 

I bumped into my ex (narcissist) at a work event I have to attend once a month (job center plus event if you are from the UK) which isn't just my company but loads of recruiters in one place. Out of politness I spoke to him as I couldn't really get away from it. He was the same as he was before always trying to say he was one better than me. I just stayed profeshal being in a work environment I wanted to be around him the least amount as possible. 
Immediately after this interaction I was shaking uncontrollably and felt I was going to have a anxiety attack so took myself out. Since I have spoken to my now partner about this and not thought much of it. Since the interaction I am increasingly more irritable, triggered by minor things and am constantly having nightmare and waking up in hot sweets. Although my ex isn't doing much in my dreams he's keeping me from going places or I have been blocked off from my now partner. With this my anxiety is supper high and I'm not sleeping much. I am currently on the highest medication dose I can be on so I don't see that changing which my drs normally do when I have a mental health wobble. 

Although its been 3 years since I saw my ex and I'm now happy. I am getting worried that I may have some ptsd or something similar coming back. Purly triggered by seeing my ex. 

Any suggestions on what this might be? How long it might last or if I should seek support? It's been about 2 weeks now which is why I'm getting more worried. 

I am also incredibly worried this may come a cycle if I continue to see him at events and maybe should speak to my manager?",False,False,ptsd,100207,Hot,2024,2,Very low,0,25,3240,neutral,positive,False,False,0,0,0

"My childhood trauma has been ""reawakened"" two years ago, and now I'm being exposed to it ever since",2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"My mother has always been very sexually promiscous (in addition to being either emotionally absent or abusive in my regards, NEVER positive or supportive) and has been cheating on my father since I was a kid, which brought me sexual trauma ever since: I've never masturbated, watched porn or had sex in my entire life and never will, I find sex outright disgusting and see it as something inherently bad and immoral (despite knowing not being necessarly the case, but you know, that's the point of trauma).
  

  
In all this, my father decided that divorce was never an option and to this day they're still formally married and live in the same freaking house; as a result, I now live in a household of two people that hate each other to death, with a step brother that my father barely and hatefully maintains since it's not his, since he's the result of one of the several affair my mother had, who didn't recur to abortion because of her anti-abortionist ideology (that tells a lot about the emotional immaturity of this pile of filth I unfortunaly share 50% of my DNA with...Oh, and did I already tell you she's no-vax as well?).
  

  
""Ok fine, but then why did you write :""For the past two years"" in the title?
  

  
Shortly before my teen, she seemed gradually stopped going outside every other night, having hours long call or conversation: as far as I'm concerned, she might have been VERY good at hiding it, but what counts is that I situation became quitier and more stationary, and I just started being delutional and (naively) started pretending that all of those bad events had never happened and just went forward with my life.
  

  
Unfortunately, in September 2021, a huge wound was abruptly reopened, 'cause after years of ""remission"", she found a new toy to resume this fucked up sadistic game: A NEW LOVER!. My mother restarted going out at night, to leave me and my brother without dinner (despite now being able to look after my self, the emotional damage still dwells in my head) and to have hours long phonecalls. 
  

  
I felt betrayed, ashamed and incredolous; I just couldn't believe that that nightmare had been reawakened all of a sudden (keep in mind that, now being 20, I've got much more awareness of what is happening then when I was, say, 8. Now I'm aware that, if in my town all this story ever happened to came out into the open, I'm not gonna be able to go out without feeling ashamed or imbaressed. Now I'm aware that, if my mother happened to become pregnant one more time, she's still gonna be adamant about not aborting and we all are gonna have to go (AGAIN) through a storm of emotional, and possibly legal consequence
  

  
Anyway, from that damned September 2021, my mental health started steadily fading, more and more, every single day of my existence (and keeps going down to this day): I now spend all of my entire day binge eating, mindlessly scrolling and daydreaming until exhaustion. I tried countless time get rid of my addiction, but this enviroment just prevents me from even getting up in the morning. It is like trying to eat healthy and exercise while your house in going on fire.


  
Every day has become a living hell, I've incessant memory of my past traumas and I don't really know for how long I'm gonna be able to hold on...

Tired of everything,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Broke my TV today and it felt kinda good. Let me give you some details before I tell you why I broke my TV. I have the cleanest room in the house yes its still a bit messy but it's a small room and not alot of places to put things so it can be hard to keep it organized and neat but still the cleanest room in the entire house. I'm the number 1 person who does anything around here. I clean the most if the house looks like it got cleaned up then it's very likely because of me. No matter what I do around here I get treated like shit the most. Anyways I had a job about 2 years ago and I bought myself some nice stuff. Only had the job for like a month probably lol. I quit cause I was just to stressed and couldn't handle the job while also dealing with other problems in my life. Later on I managed to make some more money and whatnot. But with all that I have the cleanest room and like to keep my stuff clean and as nice as I am able to. I am literally the only person in this house that has a flat screen TV it was a 40 inch I got from a family member for 150 who never took it out of the box. I have bought myself alot of nice stuff and my family is constantly in my room either just to hangout or to use my shit. When I was working I often got off late around 8pm and one night I came home after work wanting to just lay down and relax and sleep but literally everyone was in my room using my TV I was extremely mad because I wanted to sleep and relax. I know for a fact the only reason they come in my room is because it's the only spot thats clean and where they can use a TV. They will use it to watch movie or connect a console to my TV for games. I finally smashed it because I am tired of being bothered and just want to be left alone. I don't have a door to my room I don't even have a bed and even if I had a door I can't lock it because the power box is in my room. I am dealing with alot in my life and all I want is to be able to sit down in my space and be left alone. There is alot I can say about my life for you to try and understand but I am not here to type that much. All I will say is I am trying to get my GED so I can get into a program and get out of this shit hole. Literally if I had a rich sugar daddy or I won the lottery I would change my name and move away from here forever. I would give them the lottery ticket and I would only ask for a certain amount then leave without telling anyone and for once I would be able to relax and not be so stressed anymore.

\- don't try to match someone else's drinks.

https://www.popsci.com/electroshock-therapy-post-traumatic-stress-disorder

>Electroshock therapy is actually still in use—and could help treat PTSD

>**November 13, 2017**

>Patients with PTSD **treated with ECT after thinking about their traumatic memory** had a marked decrease in their emotional reaction to that memory, finds new research presented this weekend at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting. The people with PTSD didn’t forget the traumatic memory, but it stopped triggering the wave of negative emotion typical with PTSD.

>The idea, Corchs says, is that **opening up the traumatic memory makes the brain pathways related to that memory unstable.** “Then, the ECT **has a stronger impact** over these pathways.” The theory is modeled off of memory research that suggests that **memories are more susceptible to interference when they’re being actively considered.**

Often during the exam season I tend to get a period where I feel really stressed and anxious, however this last period has been turning into something much bigger and more serious.
I think I have a problem with anxiety in general, though I have never been diagnosed. I constantly worry and overthink about any minor or major problem, and when there's nothing to worry about, I set myself into paranoid episodes that something is eventually going to go wrong, either with my friendships, my family, my relationship etc. I live in constant fear that something horrible will happen, and I do not know how to turn off this feeling. It is as if I am in a ""survival mode"" the whole time, and I cannot seem to relax for a moment. My brain never lets me rest for even a moment.
Everything gets much worse during exams, because I am mostly alone during that time, and so my brain has even more free time to overthink. This results into barely being able to get up in the morning or take a shower, let alone study. In the end my result are bad and it makes me feel even more miserable. It gets into this spiral where I feel like a failure, like I am worthless and don't deserve anything, so much that I avoid when people reach out to me to hang out, because I think I am bring everyone's mood down. I also avoid talking to people about these things because I don't wanna be a burden to anyone.
Because of all of this and some issues I carry from family trauma of being showed love only when I succeed, I think I have reached a point where I cannot do it anymore. I feel so exhausted solely by just existing. My head hurts so much and I feel so heavy. It is hard to even make myself something to eat on some days. I have been crying every single day for the past three weeks. I used to have some bad periods, but I never felt physically bad from my mental state. 
I was never su*cidal, but I lowkey sometimes wish to just vanish into thin air. Not only do I feel bad, but I also feel like my behaviour is ruining it for everyone else. I have been super hypersensitive because of all of this, and even smallest things make me cry/angry/annoyed. I do not want others to suffer because of me.
I really just wanna know what is wrong with me, and how I can help myself get better. I do know the easiest route would be to get therapy, whoever i am not financially stable enough for that, and my parents would not support me.

The last year I acknowledged that I am not mentally well. My two therapists have diagnosed me with chronic PTSD and I have a lot of what they keep saying somatic symptoms because I have trauma stored in my body. 

I have frequent nightmares still not a ton probably like 2-4 times a week. I have intrusive thoughts about the events. I dissociate. I try to avoid everything and anything that reminds me of the events. The smell of lavender gets me angry. I get irritable and angry when people are yelling or when I hear kids crying. I record conversations with every person I have, I have 5 cameras installed in my house. I get easily startled. I’m constantly depressed. I go days without showering. I starve myself, I’ll eat one meal a day at most. I don’t sleep much, I wake up several times at night. I have no interest or motivation to do anything I once enjoyed. I see things that aren’t there and get scared. Every day I just feel like things would be better if I was dead. I’m in so much pain every day that I don’t want to live. I don’t want to die either because of my son. But, these thoughts won’t go away. 

I guess I am questioning my diagnosis because I just had an old therapist tell me that they think I have BPD (borderline personality disorder), all because I had a really bad relationship and I was raped by another service member. And because she said that I was self-sabotaging my relationship. After that therapist, I was referred to a different one, where he diagnosed me with chronic PTSD.

Can You Develop Your Inner Strength?,5,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Even though life can be a fantastic ride, sometimes it can also knock the wind out of your sails. ***When tough times trigger your insecurities, you can discover an inner strength that will get you through practically anything.***

**Try these ideas to get started:**

**Reflect on the tough times you've had before.** Ask yourself:

· How did I get through that situation? 

· What did I do? 

· Which of my strengths did I use? 

· What did you tell yourself? With the benefit of hindsight was that right?

· Should I to be in the same situation again, what would I do differently?

· If I were advising somebody else on how to manage this situation, what would I say?

· How will I apply what I have learned to my present situation?  
 

**Learn to talk to yourself in a resourceful way.** This will help you build up your inner strength. 

· How would you speak to your best friend about this situation?

· Learn how to craft effective affirmations – I have posted about this on my own little corner of Reddit: it’s easy to find.

· Acknowledge confusion as part of the learning process where you’re working something out.

· When were times not rough? – what made them not rough?  
   
 

**Deliberate on your thinking.** This will help gain perspective.   
   
 

· Consider the evidence for and against the thoughts you’re having.

· What alternative explanations are there for the outcomes?

· What are the implications of the outcome? – am I giving myself a balanced appraisal or only considering the worst-case scenario?

· How useful, or otherwise, are my conclusions?

· What limiting beliefs are at play here?   
    
   
 

**Consider who you regard as role models and mentors.** You selected those people because you respect and admire them.  
   
 

· What would they do?

· How would they manage this situation?

· What capabilities and resources do they have that I also have?

· How can I develop the resources they have which I don’t yet?  
   
 

**Reflect on what you've done or been through that you're most proud of.**   
   
 

· What are your most significant achievements?

· Did you have moments / periods of doubt while achieving those? – how did you over-come them?

· What personal skills, resources and capabilities did you most commonly use to achieve these things? – how can you apply those to the current situation?  
   
 

   
 

Complete the details of this affirmation: **Now that I have realised / learned \[what have you learned from reflecting on the above\], I choose to \[what have you chosen to do differently / do more of / start doing\] because \[the benefits you will gain by making these positive improvements in your life\].**

The main reason of the bullying nowadays is because I like Disneyland and going to there, since I live not far. I’m on the autism spectrum and people say untrue stuff about me, even some who work there, and I believe it because it makes me less of a man, which I also believe. 

Yes, even online trolling offends me and I hate it. Just like everyone hates me and enjoys making fun of me and seeing me suffer.

"Was this barista flirting with me, or is this just 'customer service'?",50,False,False,True,False,9,False,"Went to get coffee the other day and the barista, a girl, told me I have 'really good skin'.  I guess I'm lucky, I never had acne.  As a guy it's almost like being slapped in the face to be complimented by a girl in public who I don't know - it never happens.

I joked that my secret is I'm a vampire and never go outside, and she said she's the same.  I considered giving her my number or asking her for hers, then got....a very strong nervous feeling about it.  I didn't want to ask her that while she's technically at work.

When I left she seemed to make a point of waving and saying goodbye to me.  This was in a fairly busy coffee shop with maybe 20 people hanging around and people going in and out.

I haven't had this happen too often, usually it's just, take my order, pay, have a good day, no other conversation at all or even eye contact some times.

I feel like maybe I missed an opportunity here, in part because of social anxiety.  But I'm unsure, I'm always wary of reading into any customer service related interactions.

Using Basic Data Science for Self-improvement (Actionable),3,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi guys. I wrote a quick article demonstrating **how you can use data science as a tool for self-development**. In the demo, I focused on muscle building, but I plan to write on a variety of different topics.

I did this because I am tired of the primary source of self-improvement information in younger generations being random YouTube gurus who give unactionable advice to push their brand. I truly believe we have more than enough information to change the direction of our lives the problem is just framing your progress with a specific goal, and taking real action.

Data techniques actually have a lot of power with that and instead of giving you that fake positive reinforcement like we did something productive after watching a guru, this is a way to use your own data to make real actionable steps in the right direction.

You are also likely aware of doing dopamine detoxes where you put all of those highly stimulating activities away for a period of time so you can reset your brain. Unfortunately, the reason we keep going back to over consuming is because we lack meaning in our lives. We don't have an actually WHY or reason to keep up the good habits up for good.

Back in November I had surgery that completely ridded my body of genitals, all I have left is a small hole for urine to pass through, and some scaring.

Like, I cannot stress how much I enjoy this body. It gives me joy just to see myself like this. Every time I notice that my old parts are gone I'm just kind of happy. And even more important then that, I can just kind of be comfortable in my body for the first time since puberty, I can just sort of relax and exist in the world without there being something on my body that is constantly causing me upset. I can even shower or change without crying now. 

Though there was a lot of doubt before the surgery, an animal insitct telling me not to give up my parts, and I guess a bit of that shock is still there, I'm mostly just still me, just a lot more happy and comfortable.

Relationship Anxiety/False Memory OCD *Please Help w/ This*,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"*Long but detailed post*

Hi everyone,

I (19F) am in a wonderful 7 month relationship with a partner that I love so much. This is the second relationship I have been in (last one was when i was 14 and in HS), and I genuinely love my partner so much. Him (19M) and I are so deeply compatible, our relationship is filled with lots of healthy communication and laughter, and I adore the fact that we feel so comfortable being ourselves around each other. We're a Tinder match gone right. Being in a relationship is something I have always wanted, and though I acknowledge that being with a man is not what is going to complete my life, this kind of relationship we have is something I have always wanted.

Unfortunately, I really do struggle with anxiety and OCD. I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression when I was in 8th grade, and I have been on three different medications (Prozac, Zoloft, and now Cymbalta). Though I currently have a prescription, I haven't been taking it recently because I honestly don't support the idea of taking pharmaceuticals. I have found weed to help, it makes me really simmer in my emotions and opens new doors for my thought process. I have had a lot more ""I'm going to be okay"" thoughts when high than I have when popping a pill. As I got older, OCD symptoms really started to flourish in me around 17. I would have to do things in increments of three or I was convinced that something bad was going to be happen to me or a loved one. 17 is when I got my car and my license, and then false memory OCD started really come through. If I was driving my car and I heard a sound, I would automatically assume that I hit someone/something or killed someone/something...and didn't remember it. This was hell for me. There was one instance where I was driving home from work, it wasn't dark out, it was literally a three minute drive down the street, and I heard a noise while driving. I was so panicked that when I got home I sat by the window expecting the police to show up to arrest me for a hit and run. There have been times where I would drive around the same spot in loops to double check and make sure that whatever I heard was a noise and nothing more than that to prove to myself I didn't hit or kill anyone because my brain told me I did and didn't remember it. These are examples to really help you understand the situation I will now explain about my relationship.

I am not a disloyal person. Loyalty is a very important trait for me, and it is something I feel like I do a very good job of doing. I'm the type of friend where I will despise someone my friend doesn't like even if I don't know the person. It is a priority to me to show those I love and care for that I am there for them in my entirety. In the beginning of my relationship I went on a family trip without my partner outside the US and on that trip I was drinking. I don't drink frequently, and I prefer weed over alcohol any day. Alcohol for me is a special occasion thing, therefore I drank on this trip as celebration of my birthday. This trip had a lot of nothing to it, just lounging by the pool, walking the beach, and eating amazing food the resort had to offer. The first day of the trip (more like evening since we arrived around 3pm) was just sitting by the view with nice cocktails, dinner, and going to bed. Throughout that, as well as throughout the rest of the trip, I very frequently spoke with my boyfriend on the phone. The first night, after going to bed, I woke up in the middle of the night due to an earthquake and I had a thought ""What if I was so drunk last night that I did something with someone and I don't remember it"". And thats when I started spiraling. I was texting with my friends about it and they all assured me that there is no way that could have happened, and one of my friends even reminded me of the fact that if I was drunk to the point of memory loss, that means the situation would be sexual assault and not cheating. Then I was freaking out that I was sexually assaulted, didn't remember it, and that my boyfriend wouldn't believe me. This was a lot for me and I was losing my mind. I dwelled on this just about every day for 5 months. I spoke to my boyfriend about it, and he was so understanding and gentle and loving. He reassured me that he trusts me and that I'm okay, and that if it did happen it would be an assault and that I didn't purposefully be unfaithful. I've talked about this anxiety with my partner, my friends, and my therapist. My therapist helped break down my Attachment Style (Anxious Attachment) and I was able to feel a lot more at peace of the situation. I remember that trip and I didn't talk to any men or anything like that because things like that are not of interest to me when I have a boyfriend.

But then.. Now I'm having more anxiety about the same thing in different fonts. I don't have any social media. My contacts are just my friends and important numbers I need to have like family, my dogs groomers etc. I deleted numbers of past flings and the only men in my life other than my boyfriend are my gay besties and two other guys I met my first year of college who are like brothers to me (I even set one up with his now current girlfriend), and my boyfriend has met them and really likes them. I was on my phone the other day and all of a sudden I had this thought..""What if you just did something unfaithful"" and don't remember it. But its like..what could I have done? There's nothing I could have done or would have done that was disloyal because that is NOT like me.

So why do I keep having these thoughts??

I don't know if its because I'm finally in a relationship that is happy and healthy and its not something I'm used to so I keep having thoughts that could ruin it or what, but I'm so over it,

I'm really in love with him, he's my best friend. I would never intentionally hurt him. In the beginning of our relationship we were having a lot of problems, and I talked shit about him to my friends. But when things got better, I took the step to tell him about what I said about him to my friends and apologized for my behavior. So being a cheater is not something in my character. Like shit, I have a personal rule I established for myself that if I'm going to have sex with anyone, they need to prove negative STI results, like my current boyfriend and I did to one another when I lost my virginity to him. I don't even like touch or intimacy unless I first really get a feel for someone, so all of these thoughts of me being disloyal or unfaithful and not remembering it just doesn't make any sense, yet I continue to have them! I'll be doing nothing and then these thoughts will come into my head, or if he does something kind for me I'll think to myself that I don't deserve it because theres a chance I cheated but don't remember it.

If you read all of this, thank you so much for taking the time to do so and I would really appreciate your help with this.

You can feel euphoric on-demand with your goosebump,0,False,False,True,False,6,False,"For me, feeling this became possible, after clearing my energetic pathways. 

Commanding this energetic flow of natural ecstasy and making it appear whenever and wherever I willed it became easier. I can even make one limb flow with this energy and that limb gets covered in Goosebumps.

What does goosebumps have to do with it?

This ecstatic energy I'm talking about is present underneath your skin when you get goosebumps from positive stimuli.

Everyone can do this but not everyone is aware that there is some sort of energy current flowing when they get goosebumps. This is your spiritual energy that comes from your energetic (spiritual) body.

Before you start replying that goosebumps are only a physical reaction and there is no such thing as an energy underneath it or that it isn't spiritual.

Consider this. 

There are numerous data out there from the Indian culture, under the term "" Vyana Vayu "" about how through the conscious and unconscious usage of this energy one of the physical reactions that will occur is goosebumps.

This energy is what we activate when goosebumps also appear.

Getting goosebumps is nothing compared to the euphoric feeling you can feel over your whole body or the positive benefits that gaining control of your spiritual energy can bring you.

Different terms from all over the world for it are Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Qi, Chi, Prana, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more. 

Here's a short [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1A6fpKaMCA&t=0s) that goes more indepth about what everyone can do with this energy.

Goals: How can I tone down my need for a partnership in my life and become self fulfilled on my own?,87,False,False,True,False,12,False,"Where I was To where I am now: 

After doing a handful of psychedelics, Drinking loads of alcohol, and making the shitty decision to text my ex on New Year’s Eve to only get my already shattered heart crushed into fine powder, I decided to take a good look at myself and work hella hard to unfuck myself and find my purpose. I went completely sober, started working out, went back to school, joined multiple types of spiritual groups to figure out where I stand within my soul, and started eating healthier. After going through hell and back, I have found myself in a good group of friends whom I resonate with and my passion for what I want to do in my professional life, so all of the work I have put through the beginning of this month has massively paid off and finding my passion was a huge mile stone for me! 

Right now: 

I’m currently 20 days into my complete sobriety, practicing my life coaching skills and brain storming how I’m going to run my coaching business. I’ve found that I have an amazing gift with connecting with people, listening to them, and helping them see their potential as human beings however, I’ve been hitting a road block with my development in this area due to this subconscious desire to have a partner or someone to have sex with in my life. I tried no fap for a week to separate my dependence on wanting a partner but ended up having to fap due to the fact that I was having a difficult time connecting and listening to the women in my course. I always find myself becoming pestered by the thought of my ex sleeping with multiple guys and me getting jealous of her cause she can get whatever she wants. This jealousy makes me compare myself to her and scarcely search for a woman to fill the void within me even though my higher self knows this won’t be the answer. Though I never got addicted to any of the substances I was doing, I have become addicted to having a partner in my life which compromises my ability to see women in there free flowing goddess feminine energy. 

To Summarize: 

I want to stop giving a fuck about the fact that I don’t get laid much, about the fact that I’m single, and about other people’s love life’s. Most importantly, I want to stop giving a fuck about my ex because her heart was essentially just a giant hole that I tripped and fell into. She never even saw me as a human being and I hate the fact that my mind has to bombarded with poisonous thoughts of this women. I have unfortunately like most of us, become heavily programmed by society to react to being single, not having much sex, and to seek out partnerships. 

Where I want to be: I want to free myself of this societal bullshit because not only is it compromising how I connect with women, it’s also getting in the way of my confidence and my devoted pursuit to my passion. I want to put much less focus on my love life and stop comparing myself to others who appear to have a better love and sex life than mine. Most importantly I want to become the man that fully knows his worth, full within his own heart, and is abundant in his energy. A man that appreciates and sees a women as she is and doesn’t feel the need to seek her affection out.

I won't explain to much, however to put it bluntly an issue happened, we almost lost our unborn child due to it, however my baby and fiancée are okay. This is due to the actions of their delivery driver.

As a result I made a complaint to the company, and asked a legal advice subreddit for aid (post now deleted) in regards to potential damages as my complaint was fobbed off and called an ""inconvenience"". I didn't want compensation before this, only action, however their actions made me consider legal action.

Just…tired. ,3,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I’m so tired of my anxiety. I’ve been fighting it my entire life, like so many others. I have CPTSD from a really gruesome event I dealt with years ago. I struggle with anxiety and depression off and on. I have gone through the wringer of therapists and psychiatrists. It feels like at one time or another I’ve been on every medication under the sun. 
This last time did me in. A psych I was seeing prescribed me Wellbutrin and Guanfacine with Hydroxyzine at the end of last summer. She was explicit in that anything she gives me can be stopped cold turkey. That was my main request. 

In October I started getting some pretty rough heart palpitations and then November I ended up in the hospital due to Sepsis, from a UTI my doctor refused to culture, but that’s a whole other story. Anyways, they took me off /all/ of my medications and explicitly even said don’t go back on Guanfacine and Hydroxyzine. Okay, fine. As soon as I got out I rung up my psychiatrist who was like okay we’ll get permission from your primary to go back on Wellbutrin since it seemed to work, and add propranolol for anxiety. Remember how she was explicit that you can quit it cold turkey? She had me on 20 mg 3 times a day. 

I. Did. Not. Research. Propranolol. Omg. I ended up having a severe allergic reaction to propranolol and had to cold turkey quit it after trying to just grit and bear it for two ish weeks. Doctor said stop Wellbutrin too because by this point I’ve been in the ER two more times for high heart rate. (I have a cardiologist appointment finally next week) so, psychiatrist and doc both thought cold turkey off 60 mg propanolol would be fine. A few days later I landed back in the ER not once but two days in a row, because of rebound. The second time they prescribed metoprolol. Another nightmare drug I didn’t read about. It’s my own fault, I know, but I was desperate for these panic attacks and high heart rate events to just stop and the Cali medical system takes forever to see a specialist.
 
So while I’m on metoprolol I start getting nauseous every day and puking anything I tried to eat. This got worse to where I couldn’t swallow after taking it. An hour after taking it, my heart rate would blast up to 150 and I’d end up with severe red flushing all over my body. And itching. 3 more ER visits and they have done EKGs, CT scan, CT with dye, xray, blood test. All is “fine”. Until I finally put 2+2 together that this was another allergic reaction. 🙃 I was on 12.5 mg twice a day, tried to taper that in half and only made it a day and a half and had to quit. Doctor okay with this, before anyone jumps on me lol. It wasn’t like I could just keep going anyways. 

Now I’m hella rebounding, all though I feel better off it except for the anxiety and heart rate issue from the rebound. At least I can breathe and swallow. Still can’t eat though.  Primary doc prescribed Xanax to replace it, .25 mg. I have taken a benzo in the past and stopped when I didn’t need it anymore. Like, ten years ago. I’m only going to use it when the panic attacks are so severe nothing works. And I am well aware of not taking them often due to addiction and withdrawals. But I’m frustrated and feel like I’m back at square one. In this time my insurance changed too so I don’t have my old psychiatrist, which is fine at this point, so I got a referral for a new one and a new therapist bc had the same insurance issue there. 

I’m 32 and it feels like I’ve been running in circles trying to deal with my mental health for years and it gets me nowhere. I’m so sensitive to drugs and have so many surprise allergies. I’m. Tired.

im the dumbest and most unluckiest person on earth and you can’t convince me otherwise,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"a year and a half ago I embarrassed myself by forgetting my own bus number in front of a whole lot of people

next day I show up and the whole class knows about the incident, I play cool and play it off and feel like I handled it well, shame for me is that that was the last day of school before the infamous 2 week break which turned into a year and a half cuz of COVID

sooo i got to spend most of that period just worrying about what they’d think of me after it, I feel so much regret cuz it was what caused me to develop anxiety and become more sensitive to it which made me start fucking up a lot more in decision making and more susceptible to mistakes in general, felt like I devolved basically lmao and I can’t help but feel that a lot of things I did to myself or caused wouldn’t have happened had I not been so occupied with this new problem of mine and had been paying more attention in general

The funny thing is that I still am not sure whether this whole anxiety mess happened because of this incident or because I failed to distract myself properly in the quarantine period to the point where I started worrying and overthinking this minor thing cause I had nothing better to do which also makes sense since I wasn’t worrying about it when it first happened 

Or it’s just bad luck and this incident just so happened 2 days before isolation and if it hadn’t I wouldn’t be like this which would be fucking crazy, this possibility doubles the regret if I’m honest

oh and btw after that period it turned out nobody recalled the incident or even hinted at it so hurray a whole year and a half of chronic worrying for absolutely nothing turned out I did handle it well

2 days after I finally have my relief and I get scammed in a game in my brother’s account WOOOO which re-opens the just recently closed would of endless anxiety and the most unrealistic possibilities on earth 

I swear I wouldn’t even be surprised if some of you didn’t believe all this but unfortunately enough that’s just how bad my luck is and it’s destroying me really

I just wanted to share this to let off some steam and maybe get some advice, relief, or people with similar experiences cause I feel like I’m the only person in the universe that managed to somehow against all known laws of physics embarrass themself in school a day or two before online school, it’s fucking crazy man

War. Rape. Catastrophic accident. Child abuse. These are things that are so horrible that your brain gets stuck in a permanent state of ‘danger!’ level arousal.

Right now, im REALLY struggling mentally, to the verge I'm thinking about self harm or worse.

I'm 30m, previously married and another 4 and a half relationship that was more recent. 

I just don't know what to do. 3 months ago I lost my best friend of 13 years who was also my partner of 3 months. We'll Call her A. 

We had finally realised that we wanted to be together and so we did, everything was perfect, I was for the first time in my life, genuinely happy, I felt worthy, loved. She completed me. 

My ex partner got extremely jealous and threw all sorts of accusations out to A who eventually believed them, without any proof of anything, because there was nothing. But A knows my past, when me and my ex wife first got together, I cheated on her. Everything and anything there is to know about me A knows. She knows me better than I know myself, we have never had any secrets between us about anything. 

So A eventually left and now wants nothing to do with me. She was my rock. I have very few friends (of whom I'd burden..) and I have no contact with my family due to them being toxic. 

So now Ive lost my best friend and well, im not coping. At all. I have all these thoughts going around in my head and I can't stop them, I am slowly spiraling and the worst part is I can feel it. The only thing stopping me is my children, but I think I'm barely holding on.

I just don't know what to do, I am still madly in love with A and I'd do absolutely anything to get her back, I NEED her in my life, wether that's just as a friend or my partner, but I can't live without her, I just can't.

I can't get up in the morning because all I want to do is sleep. What should I do?,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Every single day, when I wake up, I \[M22\] struggle to get out of bed. Right after I wake up, the only thought on my mind is ""I need more sleep"" and it seems to block out almost every urge to wake up early or be proactive about things. More often than not, I tend to be on-time or a few minutes late for important classes/meetings (but I do oversleep more often than I think I should). I have a really unhealthy habit of setting 15-30 minute timers after I wake up to get a *little* more sleep, and after doing this over and over again, I end up sleeping 1-2 hours more than I intend to. Usually, I end up getting 9-11 hours of sleep instead of the average 7-8 for adults my age. Usually, if I have no commitments in the morning, I will get out of bed for good between 12PM and 2PM.

This is something I have struggled with for all of my life, even before I started treatment for depression, anxiety, and recently, ADHD. People have always just told me that I was a ""night owl"" since I feel energized and creative in later hours (sometimes until 1AM or 2AM), which is fine I guess. Even when I sleep earlier at night, I still oversleep in the morning. And when I sleep in, even into the afternoon, people just tell me ""Oh, you're a hardworking college student who finally has time to relax. You deserve to sleep in!"" I still feel like my sleeping tendencies are excessive and abnormal.

I also feel severely tired throughout the day. I drink caffeine in the morning, usually about 4 cups (32 fl oz) of black coffee. Even still, I will get super sleepy usually around 4-5PM and have to drink more coffee or an energy drink to keep myself awake. I think I might be so tired because of medication, but I also think that my meds are working, so I don't really want to stop taking them.

I feel like if I found a way to get myself up in the morning after 7-8 hours of sleep, I could enjoy my mornings, be so much more productive, and feel like I'm getting the most out of every day. I'm starting to get worried too, since I graduate college this semester and start my full time job in July. I don't want my irregular sleeping habits to get in the way of being a reliable employee. 

What do I do? I feel helpless... I've tried so many things to help myself but still, every time I wake up, I feel like I'm a zombie with one thing and one thing only on my mind: more sleep. **Do you have any advice for how I can address this or what habits I can start practicing to be more proactive about waking up at a reasonable time?**

&#x200B;

Below is more info about the meds i take and the things I've tried before:

**Medication:**  
Currently, I take 300mg of Bupropion in the morning for depression, which apparently is supposed to give me a small energy boost, though I have never felt it. I also take 25mg of Hydroxyzine at night for my anxiety along with 0.1mg of Clonidine for ADHD. I know these medications can make you feel tired, but I'm worried about stopping treatment. I've been taking Buproprion and Hydroxyzine for about 8 or 9 months now, and I started the Clonidine a week ago. Are any of these medications causing sleep problems?

**Things I've Tried:**  
At this point, I feel like I've tried everything that has been recommended to me. Choosing a loud alarm or changing my alarm sound often? I just turn it off and go back to sleep like nothing happened. Placing my phone across the room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off? I just walk back to my bed half-asleep and crash again. I've even moved my coffee pot to my bedroom and set a timer on it to make coffee when I'm supposed to wake up in the morning. I love coffee in the morning. Still doesn't work. Those apps that make you do math problems or jumping jacks to turn off the alarm don't work either. I just power off my phone. My therapist recommended that I establish some sort of morning and night routine/rituals to encourage me to regulate my sleep schedule, but nothing I try to establish ever sticks.

Did you realise how bad the society
treats/concentrates on suicidal or mind broken people. We always see in documentaries like this guy has this disease or this guy is gay and you should respect him but nothing about mind broken / depressed people. I am not saying we are in a higher position or should get treated better. I am saying we should be at an equal position. Then they would probably use like ""They die."" or something like that as an excuse but most of us die to doing suicide not accepting this horrible fate and they mostly don't listen I heard so many people make jokes like ""Ughh why would you do suicide."". They should be asking why not the reason we die is not us it is them and they don't care. Did you ever see one post saying that his psychiatrist cured his depression. NO you probably didn't. They earn money by doing pretty much nothing and think they are doing hard work. The little population that comes out of this horrible fate does it them selfs in a long process losing friends and maybe even family. 

To clarify how hard it is to get out of depression let me tell people who don't have depression what is going on in this broken mind.

As we turn depressed we start seeing the world in its true colors. The bad society / People / Life itself everything is pain. You start thinking philosophically and that is good that is the true nature of humans. Thinking philosophically not painted in the paint of society or medics. The reason it is good and we are still depressed is that society doesn't think this is right and tries to paint is in that colorless color of it. If everyon ewoild have this kind of mindset we wouldn't be depressed. Working towards equality of eveyone not just visible things that we think have to be fixed so we can see no differentiation between them and us. We are also depressed cause so many people say depression should be cured but still make fun of people that have. When I was a kid we had a really nostalgic guy that had suicidal thoughts and there were girls and boys everywhere making jokes about him. I wanted to do something but what could I do. I would get outcasted myself. He started thinking a little bit more philosophically after that too. 

The more we get depressed the more philosophically we think and that makes us realise how bad humanity is and the more depressed we get. If you think you have depression because you are sad you aren't you are just sad and nothing like us. The longer you have depression the harder it is to get out and at one time almost impossible. The thing you get depression from is the thing you concentrate most on with philosophy but everthing comes to humanity at the end. It is all our fault making everthing like this. Painting our own colors to grey...

So people don't ask I have depression since I am 9 because of prejudice of my looks and thinking and many more things. I wont tell how old I am I hope you understand. I wish you keep on thinking philosophically or start thinking like that and I wish you a wonderful day/night/noon/morning/evening.",False,False,depression,1007667,Hot,2024,2,Low,1,25,3084,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Is it too much of a burden to tell close friends that you have semi-suicidal thoughts?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Some real quick context here.

They've told me numerous times that if I ever feel deep in the trenches that I should reach out to them and talk.

Unfortunately due to various circumstances my mental state has really deteriorated and I've been plagued with thoughts of ""wanting to die"". It's never been to a point of ""wanting to commit suicide"" but rather at the level of ""I wish someone would hit me with a car"".

I recognize that these are pretty severe thoughts and I'm also slightly worried they may further expand in scope. That being said I've never vocalize these thoughts to anyone, but now I feel like I need to tell someone to feel less isolated inside of my thoughts.

That being said I'm worried about telling my friends, not that they won't worry or won't try and help, but because I don't want to burden them with something that, realistically, they cannot help fix. I don't want to become some sort of mental burden for these people that I care about.

Realistically I should contact therapists and psychiatrists but due to my location, and timezone, getting in contact with them is unreliable, and the ones I can get in contact with may be not ideal either.

it’s so exhausting to see people constantly claim to have ptsd and claim that every. negative. experience. they have had is “trauma.” 

throughout my time on social media i have seen SO many people claim to have ptsd from a significant other cheating, losing a friend due to petty drama, etc. 

i am not trying to invalidate anyone by saying that these experiences aren’t hard and that they can’t be traumatic, and i have no problem with people asking about this to genuinely understand the disorder, but by definition in the DSM you do not qualify for a ptsd diagnosis unless you have been “exposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation,” by either you directly experiencing it, witnessing it occur to another person, learning of it happening to a close friend or relative, or being repeatedly exposed to details of a distressing event. 

i am so tired of opening up to people about my PTSD and hearing “oh yeah i have ptsd too, my girlfriend left me for someone else.” like...really? 
do NOT compare me being raped, someone nearly getting killed, or witnessing an act of extreme violence to you having a bad break up. it’s fucking insensitive, minimizing, and plain disrespectful to everyone with a ptsd diagnosis. 

im sorry if this sounded harsh, but i am just so fed up and tired of this shit. it’s hurtful.

edit: i am not talking about people who actually have ptsd and choose to only share smaller events. i am also not saying it’s okay to compare traumas to see who’s is “worse,” and i am not trying to tell people what is and isnt trauma. im just stating that recently people have been throwing the term “ptsd” around the same way they do adhd and ocd, and it’s actually really harmful.",False,False,ptsd,100208,Top,2021,2,High,25,34,2653,neutral,negative,False,False,1,1,1

When you come to terms, when you humble yourself only then will you understand. 

You will understand that good people may jduge you. Your partner may judge you. That is their right. Make sure, to do whatever it is you can to show them and most importantly yourself that you have changed and can give them and yourself much more than you previously could.

"Christians, Do you ever feel conflicted between your thoughts and faith?

The last year I have spent time building a better one. In October I even got baptized.

I (24F) really would like to find someone to enjoy life with and settle down. Most believers say things like “The bible says he who finds a wife. He’ll find you.” Or “Trust God’s timing. When he’s ready he’ll bless you with the man for you, stop trying to take matters in your own hands.” So I go about life not really doing much to influence I meet people. Then I (also an introvert) get told by my mom and other that I’ll never find someone I don’t get out and put myself out there. 

I have tried apps like Bumble and even though I meet people I feel super guilty. I feel like I’m rushing God’s timing and that the people I meet on there couldn’t honestly be really for me because they weren’t given by Him. Then again, how can I ever meet anyone if I sit completely still and don’t do anything to meet anyone? All this gives me great anxiety, confusion and then all of that leads to depression. Am I possibly overthinking things too much? Where I feel comfort(my faith) is also making me anxious and its defeating.

I feel like no girl would want to date me,0,False,False,True,False,4,False,"So I'm 22 years old, male, and a full time student at my university, and I work full time as well. I had my phase where I'd go out every weekend to bars to try and hook up with random girls, but I just don't find any value in that anymore.

Anyways, the reason I feel like no girl would want to date me is that I still live with my parents. Not only my parents, but my WHOLE family, in a small 1500 square foot home. My grandparents live with us as well, and its technically their house. My dad never moved out. It gets worse though. My dad has a birth defect where his fingers are not fully developed. My sister is 19 years old, and a radical lesbian feminist. She shaves her head, doesn't wear a bra, and starts fights with everyone every single night regarding gender roles. There is screaming and crying going on every single night in the house, and she's also on some medication for her mental problems. Also, my 40 year old aunt, who is also a felon and a crystal meth addict, decided to move back into the house recently. So there's currently 7 people living in my tiny home.

I know I sound like a dick talking about my fathers birth defects like that, but for some reason I'm just so insecure about other people (particularly girls) meeting him and just finding it too weird.

But I feel like I'm justified by feeling insecure about having girls come over my house for the other reasons I pointed out. I just feel like no girl would be comfortable hanging out with me at my house. Also, the only place where we could privately hangout is in my bedroom, which is limiting and not a good time at all.

The only person in my family I'd feel comfortable introducing a girl to, is my mother, really.

Anyways, my goal is to graduate, get a better job, and move out as soon as possible so I can finally have a dating life. I've never had a girlfriend in my life and I've been feeling really lonely lately with the hours of work I've been putting in towards work and school. I don't have time for anyone or anything.

"Scared I triggered something, need advice please",2,False,False,True,False,10,False,"Ugh. I’ve been avoiding posting this on Reddit since yesterday, cause it’s embarassing.

I know a lot of people do it, but I don’t know posting it on the internet seemed weird to me, oh well here I go, I need answers.

I got my holter monitor results a couple of days ago, everything came back mostly normal, except 188bpm during an argument with my manager which was seen as “inappropriate “ and not “abnormal” by my cardiologist since I’m 19, and my bpm can technically get to 200bpm which to me 188 should be close enough to be considered concerning?? But that’s a different story.

He also said there was nothing electrically wrong with my heart which prompted me to think everything was okay and I’m just experiencing anxiety 

Anyways, since then, I’ve had minimal palps, some flutters, some skipped beats, but once a day at most for about a week.

I started masturbating again because of this, I thought I was okay by what my cardiologist said.

the first few times nothing happened, no symptoms, no palps. did it for abt 4 days straight with this. 

the last time i did it, my heart was pumping hard, and skipped a beat, i stupidly kept going though. once i was finished, again nothing.

i was laying down, feeling sort of anxious?? then i felt a huge flutter, then fast HR after which i never felt before after a flutter.

of course this sent me into a panic, and ive been anxious and having flutters and extra beats since

this prompted me to schedule a stress test friday with my cardiologist since he said to do so if the palps keep happening.

i just wanted to know if i should be worried abt this or if i couldve triggered something

I am not sure if my boyfriend is being too controlling or if I’m just overthinking.,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I have been in multiple abusive and controlling relationships. It’s kinda hard for me to recognize when someone is doing these things to me until I am breaking down emotionally. I also dissociate a lot so it is hard for me to remember a lot of things but when I do I fixate on them. 

I am an over thinker. I over think everything my boyfriend says and does to me and around me. I feel like he tells me what to do a lot though and I know he is insecure, which makes him controlling in certain ways. (From what I have noticed) 

Him and I took a like month break, I felt like we were done with the relationship. I got a job stripping and I was doing okay for myself. It really wasn’t a bad experience from the other stories and things I’ve heard. It was actually really nice, but I gave it up to be with him. I gave him a second chance and quit that job. He told me he didn’t want me getting caught up in that life and that I’m probably not going to find someone who actually respects me. Also that he was too insecure to be okay with other men touching me. I felt put down and I didn’t really say much. 

This morning he told me to put on makeup to look more scary. (I like the goth and alternative styles) I told him I about maybe doing that because I keep getting approached by men when I am not with him. It like really bothers him when I tell him about people hitting on me. 

Last night when he was making food in the kitchen he kept eating some of the stuff he was gonna put in the pot, when I did it he was jokingly like “ah ah ah” but then the second time I did it he told me “do as you’re told”. He said it like he was joking but he never said he was joking and I don’t remember him laughing so I just overthink it. 

Last night I also like messed up and read the time wrong, I get him from work right now. He told me that I screwed myself (which I did but that doesn’t help anything) and he gave me a choice. He said I can either stay here for three hours or go do what I was going to do and he’ll have to wait for me to come get him after he gets off work. 

I am very submissive when treated and talked to a certain way because of trauma. When he tells me what to do I feel my stomach drop. I feel scared of what he will do to me if I don’t do as he says. That’s not from him though. That is just my PTSD. From other people.

Advice,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Hello. I’m looking for some advice on if I should seek help for ptsd, or if it even sounds like I have ptsd. 

Over the new year, I went through a traumatic psychedelic trip from hell where I experienced levels of anxiety I have never felt before. I felt that I was dying and was out of control. My partner also had a bad trip; neither of us were the source of each others anxiety, but we were simply too overwhelmed with the dosage.

 He did his best to help me once he was coming down with the help of his ssris. He suggested we go on a drive around town because I was freaking out in our apartment.
We drove in what felt like endless circles and my feeling of dread dwindled only after a few hours of this.

 Now; any time we are in the car at night time for any long stretch, I get these flashbacks which lead to panic attacks. I dissociate and feel like I am right back in the trip. This just happened and he had to take me home; and we’ve come to a point of not driving at night. I wonder if this qualifies for ptsd because otherwise I do not think about the trip, and if we never drove at night I don’t think I would be triggered. How should I best approach this?

I can't tell if this is anxiety or not.,1,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I have experienced certain things in certain situations multiple times in my life. I have had no bad past or anything (I thought I should mention it because it's always brought up when I do research on what it could be). The best way to explain is to give an example. 
I will be in a city I'll be fine for a certain amount of time and then it hits me. I begin to feel light headed. My breathing may increase.  Everything feels like it's getting louder I can't focus. I just need to get out of there. 
That has happened to me multiple times not always just randomly and if I'm worried of it happening it might happen again. But like I said sometimes I'll be completely fine. 
Sometimes I get this pain in my chest. My breathing will be very weird. I know there's nothing wrong physically. But inside I'm worried there's something serious so I begin to search up symptons and then I feel more scared that there's something wrong (its never anything bad). Then I'll feel worse and worse. 
Sometimes out of nowhere I'll just begin to be really shakey my head will feel weird. My heart starts racing. Then when I get in a ""safe space"" you can call it (my room is one for instance where i feel comfortable) I'm left there shaking uncontrollably for half an hour. I'll do something else after and still be shaking for an hour more until it stops. 
I'll be fine on a plane for one flight but then out of nowhere I'll just feel really paranoid of something going wrong. I will constantly worry about it crashing. I will be sure of that that's going to happen (it never does). 
I have not thrown up in 7 years but every time I feel like I'm going to be sick i never am. It's always because of a feeling of something being wrong or feeling off. When I'm scared of saying something I feel sick. When I think ive done something wrong I feel sick. 
In my head I escalate situations that's have happened or may happen to the point where I am sure something bad will happen so I try to avoid it but then when it happens it's not as bad as I thought it would be. 
I am worried of someone shouting at me for saying something wrong or for doing the wrong thing. Then I end up keeping myself quiet and avoiding those situations where I think that may happen. 
If someone could give me advice on what I should do I would appreciate it. I have never actually spoken to anyone about this before because I'm always told there's nothing wrong with me when my chest feels really tight.

I am a 22F! I turn 23 next month. I think I am depressed. I think I’ve been depressed for about a year now; but it’s been really bad recently. I think I’ve been avoiding the word depression and accepting that I may have it; but I feel like a classic case now. Here’s some background;

For the past two years, after a bad marijuana episode, I’ve been stuck in an off and on brain fog/ DPDR  stage; my cognitive abilities have declined; and I feel mentally so bleh. Recently it’s been getting better with more “good days” but I still feel not the same. 

I also lost about 30 pounds 2-3 years ago. 2021-2022 were great years. I gained the 30+ pounds back in end 2022-2023 and haven’t lost them since; I’ve been very hyper focused on getting back to how I looked; I hate looking in the mirror; none of my clothes fit me anymore; I feel large and fat. I also have really bad allergies to my cats too that I’m trying to manage. 

I’ve been in a relationship with a man for a year now. In that year span; he has lied to me a few times; and emotionally, not physically cheated on me 1.5 ish times. He broke my trust completely; I trust him a little; and then recently he shattered it again. I love him but I feel numb towards him now. It’s hard with everything else I’m going through but I told him I’d give him a second chance. We’ve gone through a lot but I see him trying; it’s hard though because I know deep down I deserve a love that doesn’t HAVE this many ups and downs… + we’re long distance now (have been for about 5 months) but it’s hard to leave him. 

My sleeps really messed up. I stay up till hours like this; 3-4am. For no reason. And pay the price the next day. I have no type of disipline or motivation for anything. I want to stay home all day. I haven’t reached out or seems my friends in months. Everytime I try I just want to go home. I hate how my clothes look and just feel anxious. I can’t stick to calorie counting.. gym… anything fr. 

I feel constantly dissociated. Numb. Tired. I sleep till noon 1pm. I barely leave the house. I feel disconnected with my best friends; I’ve gone through some shit recently I don’t feel comfortable telling them + I know they don’t like my man so our relationship has just.. been weird. 

Oh I’m also in school. I’ve failed the same class 4 times. It’s my last time taking it. It’s the last class I need to graduate. That’s also driving me nuts! 

I’m very self aware; I’d like help getting out this funk. I’ve tried 2 therapist but my insurance sucks and the experience sucked. They had me seeing them once every MONTH and one even told me “you seem to function well you can’t be depressed!”

Any advice? Where to start? I want to get out of this funk. I’d like to avoid medication for now. ",False,False,depression,1007674,Hot,2024,2,Medium,0,22,2754,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I used to daydream as a coping mechanism but now it has completely taken over my life,112,False,False,True,False,29,False,"A few years ago, I started daydreaming to fill a void that I felt. I think I generally have quite an active imagination and when I started reading romance books when I was 14, I got really absorbed into the idea of having a boyfriend to comfort you or give you support whenever you need it. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the fact that I don't have a dad or a male figure to look to while growing up, but I've always fantasised about having a partner to cuddle with and to comfort me. 

Anyway, fast forward a couple of years, whenever I'm feeling sad or stressed because of exams or an eating disorder that I'm dealing with, I immediately get back into fantasising to escape the reality that I'm in. It has become this safe and comfortable place for me to exist in where I can control everything and where I can seek the support and comfort that I want to get.

However, this has led to the issue where I feel like I've gotten increasingly detached from reality as this is such an unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel increasingly unable to face reality and my life because of how intense my daydreams have gotten. I feel like I've formed an entirely different life that is so much more comfortable for me.

I would just really like some help as to how to deal with this issue because I need to start focusing on my life and taking control of my studies instead of constantly living a life that leads to nowhere.

Weed can ruin some people,126,False,False,True,False,24,False,"I was always taught in health class that cannabis isn’t addictive, so when I started using recreationally I wasn’t at all worried about the risk of getting addicted.

I became a heavy stoner in the 11th grade and the only thing I was worried about was weed becoming a gateway drug like we’re told it does. By that logic I figured as long as I stick to weed I’d be fine. I just had to be cautious of not letting it escalate to something worse. But it did. And it happened from weed alone.

how do i stop assuming patterns? please read im begging,10,False,False,True,False,5,False,"i know the title isnt very eye-catching. so i hope at least one person can read this. i dont know how to explain it to you, but im a very “pattern-oriented” person. almost all the things i assume, observe, and recognize is because i constantly arrange it into a pattern. 

ex: (this person) acts like (this) because (this) and ive recognize (this and this etc)

i understand this (topic) because I’ve recognized (this) and (this) and therefore (this) may happened because of (all of those observations) 

the problem with this pattern thing is that it makes me assume my life is a pattern as well. 

ex: if i had a bad month last year january, then i’ll likely have it bad again this year. 

if i did amazing for last year’s 1st school term but did bad at the 2nd term, then it’ll probably happen again. 

if a relationship failed at august last year, then another will bound to fail again this year’s august.

because of this, i start assuming something bad will happen. and i guess thats normal to assume. everyone uses experiences to learn and try to avoid things. the problem is im really trying to just be more positive. these “negative” things wreck me and make me assume something bad will happen and because of my anxiety with that, i end up spiraling and maybe even leading myself back again to that “pattern” that i “assume would happen”. 

another is a make myself do certain “things/actions” in order to avoid “an event” i completely assumed in my head and i think that if i dont do it, something bad will happen. 

ex: if i dont put my snake ring facing upwards then im going it have a bad day because the last time i didnt i had a bad day.

does anyone get what i mean? 

is this normal?

It’s just tough sometimes,4,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I’m back in depression. I’ve been in remission from depression for 11 years, after being actively in depression for 21 years prior. I know why I’m triggered. I know what triggered me. But what it comes down to is…it’s such a fight to get out, why bother? (No I am not in danger of hurting myself). 

Over the past 11 years I’ve seen that everyone is hurting and no one can really help anyone. In reality we spend most of our time unintentionally hurting each other.  Those of us that are doing well are able to block the pain or separate from it, but it doesn’t mean that we were hurt by that person or their action. It also makes me aware of how much I’ve probably hurt others when being depressed. 
It’s a cycle and it feels like it’s everywhere. 

Does being in remission feel good, of course. But last time it took 3 different types of therapist,  many additional alternative modalities, a house down payment in out of pocket costs and we didn’t have kids. I also had less people who knew I was ill and therefore less opinions. I made the mistake of advocating for mental wellness while in remission and now I’m super exposed to lots of unhelpful opinions.

My day to day struggles with social interaction,6,False,False,True,False,1,False," When I first entered college, we were divided into groups, and as always, I was shy around new people, sharing few thoughts. I thought, just like high school, eventually, I would get well-adjusted and make friends. However, to my surprise , it didn't happen. The group I was with, consisting of 12 people, became really close together, and I was left out mainly because I was not engaged with them. I even experienced some sort of selective mutism, where I would not speak unless directly addressed, and when I did, it was in a very low tone.

In the next semester, with group changes, the same scenario repeated, but this time, I was significantly affected by the fact that I was a loner and couldn't study properly. I wouldn't attend lectures during the day, staying up late, and I even missed two closing sessions. The group had lost faith in me, and at the time, I think they saw me as a failure.

Moving on to the next semester with a new group, this time I've identified a few mistakes from the past and tried to adjust. I was active in the sessions and attempted to be collaborative. However, one mistake I made is using too many fancy words when the doctor asked us to give feedback at the end of the closing session. I thought it was too cliché. I even noticed a pattern that with people I liked, I would try to stay away from them and watch from afar. For example, I liked a girl in my group, thinking we had many common interests, but I never really talked to her.

Anyways, I would greet my  groups if I met them in the hallways and so on. I tried to approach four of them and talk about random stuff, mostly university-related. However, it didn't work out. Now they see me; sometimes they greet me, sometimes they don't, and a few of them would never greet me at all. I think it's because of a few situations where I would wait for my ride to come, and they come with a group of people talking with them. So, I'd act busy on my phone, not wanting to invade their space because my relationship with them is pretty professional, to say the least.

My attitude on campus  days is pretty much the same. I observe the doctor, and when they say to go check out the samples, I take a look and then leave. I try to join other people, but I find them divided into groups, and I always see those people together. Sometimes I think it's too late to make friends; everyone knows each other at this point, and they've decided to stick to a few people. I have doubts. whenever I try to study, I have these negative thoughts that I am dislikable, perceived as someone with no social skills, and just annoying.

Sometimes I distract myself, go watch Netflix, or scroll on social media, and thoughts become really intensive, especially during group projects or similar situations. Because you have to pick a few friends to work with, and people are really picky when it comes to those matters, like making a research where you have to pick 10 people to work with. It's just really anxious to think about that I'll be the only one left, and it's all online, so I can't really go and approach them and ask how I can join. I've never been known to them as someone who is hardworking, even though I changed this semester. My grades are better, but I feel anxious at times, especially when we go to campus. I keep thinking about this over and over and over and over. I don't understand what is wrong with me. Maybe it's because I don't know how to approach people, I don't have the skills, or maybe it's a mix of shyness, self-doubt, lack of confidence, and fear of rejection. I just don't understand. I know there's something that has to be fixed in the way I represent myself to the world, but I just can't point it out. That's why I need a third point of view on this.

Years spent studying and training while everyone I knew would party not that I didn't of course god forbid a premed actually enjoy their lives.

Father and mother lose their jobs I feel so guilty going to some stupid fucking university with my pipe dreams when my folks back home barely get by, pick up a job as a damn food service worker to help out.

Ochem ochem ochem, of course I'd get the teacher that would be fired in one year due to his amazing ineptitude at teaching. Of course.

Yup I'm balancing two jobs now while trying to lead this fucking biology club where everyone is cut throat or just doesn't care. My mother says she'll always support me but she's been working odd jobs all her life and only some strange devoutness is keeping her alive.

My dad doesn't talk much...he hasn't worked in years and doesn't care. God I hate him so much...just bumming around with his worthless sociology degree from fucking Bangladesh. He keeps telling me to apply to more schools like that's the golden ticket like 14 fucking rejections in my face wasn't enough. He keeps talking about people he doesn't know who get into Texas or Florida and his damn friend who is a dentist. He says things like ""people will salute you"". Mother fucker is Death of a Salesman written all over.

And of course everyone is asking me which school I got into. I know it's not true but I feel like everyone has lost respect for me, my girlfriend who will probably break up with me for a guy who actually got accepted to ONE school, my roommates who used to look up to me and my little brother who isn't so little any more.

The startup aims to support employees feeling happier and at ease at work 😊, by using the right level of support and mindfulness that works for you as an individual (not everything will work for everybody).

The idea came after several years working for big and small companies and seeing colleagues and experiencing ourselves high levels of stress, unhappiness, burnout and others. 

If you can support us by filling in the below little survey (5min) we would be forever grateful 🙏. As it will help us to shape our startup.

Running EVERYDAY helps depression and anxiety,80,False,False,True,False,7,False,"So..

I'm noticing a pattern. 

And that is I wake up depressed sometimes. And I'm fully accepting that I'm not always going to wake up on the right side of the bed... Sometimes I wake up and I don't have motivation, I don't have inspiration.

And recently I had this.. Random urge to wanna run a marathon.

I'm an athlete and I love to workout and I just so happened to hit up my friend, and he just so happened to be on DAY 1 of training for a marathon.

AND not just any marathon, but a marathon where you skydive into the entrance of the marathon.

So I'm going to be skydiving into the entrance of a marathon in January and run 26 miles.

BUT.. here is the problem, I have to run enormous amounts, like every week I'm running a marathon in miles.

And the miles just keep going up, Eventually I'm running 20 miles in one sitting.

I mean thats damn near a marathon! And thats just in training.

Now a lot of people would look at that and say that that sounds dreadful, and it has been challenging but I've been so inspired to do this that I said fuck it, whatever pain I go through, I will go through. 

And one thing I realized is, running helps my mental health so much..

The benefit isn't to my body.

For example, I woke up today and I wasn't feeling super great, and I just started running and at first it sucks, but eventually you get that runners high and something just clicks. 

And while I was running I was blasting motivational music, and I just kept telling myself ""I'm A CHAMP""

I just kept telling myself like I'm a champ, I'm doing this. I'm running. Im feeling good even though my legs hurt.

 And something about getting up and exercising right when you wake up instead of getting on your phone, getting sunlight, getting fresh air instantly hardwires your brain for success.

I ran 57 minutes and it was literally the best time for me to just sit and think.

You get into a trance. When your running for that long, it does suck but you just start day dreaming while you run.

57 minutes goes by so freaking quick, it feels like 20 minutes every single time.

You think about life, things you've done, what you want to do, I get the best ideas while running, and I really work out the problems in my head.

And I come home, I feel more stable, I feel more mature and I feel more clear on my intention for the day in what I want to do.

Its like a meditation combined with all the endorphins it shoots up to your brain.

It can literally transform your day.

Its been such a ritual that I'm just thankful for this marathon. Like this marathon is training me to have more discipline and to meditate and feel good in the morning.

So after my run I felt so inspired to create and work on videos and do what I love. I didn't get distracted and got my goals done.

And I feel like I owe a lot to the run in the morning for jumpstarting my day for success.

So to summarize running 10x's your day and it wakes you up.

After a run in the morning I'm wide awake!

Hope you gained value from this and happy running!!

How do I cope with not being in a relationship?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"This sounds stupid but I (18M) get genuinely sad often because I don’t have a special person like that. Some people I know that are my age are involved with a lot of the “hook up” culture and nobody seems to genuinely care about their partners. But I also have friends who have been in beautiful relationships for years.

I have very bad attachment issues due to neglect from my mom and trauma from the only 2 “relationships” I’ve been in. One was when I was 14-15 and another was when I was 16, neither of them were healthy at all. I also don’t really/never have gotten what I would call “love” from my family so I really desire genuine love. It feels like I’ve been fighting by myself for so long and I just want to be able to be held by somebody and feel safe. It’s gonna sound pathetic saying this but a lot of times I have to fall asleep holding my pillow trying to imagine it’s some kind of love.

I can’t help feeling like I’m not worthy of somebody and maybe that’s why. I have a few beautiful friendships but there’s a different level you get in a relationship I feel. Everybody seems to either be fine with sleeping around with people or they’re in seemingly perfect relationships. It feels like everybody knows what they’re doing, it feels like they have it all figured out. I don’t want the first one and I have a hard time seeing the second one happening to me as much as I crave it. I know people usually answer things like this with giving it time, but how much time do I have to give man. I feel so alone and I’m exhausted of fighting by myself, I just want to be able to love a girl and receive that same love. What am I supposed to do?

Help with identifying symptoms,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello,
i am 9 months into a deep trauma process. May last year I realized that my spouse has gaslit me about his substance abuse (which I knew nothing about). 

The whole thing is a really complex situation and borh of us are working on a lot of things related to all of this. 
There is a trauma symptom I have that I don’t know what the name is. I think its quite specific to trauma situations where you didn’t know what was happening at the time.
Sometimes a memory will come up of a moment where I was being lied to/gaslit and I did not know it at that moment. I relive it like looking at it as a third person but still me and I am desperate and helpless because its happening and there is nothing I can do to change it. I can’t stop repeating the scene in my head, I guess I am desperate to change it so my brain repeats it as if I could somehow change it the 266. time it plays out, and my emotional pain and distress ramps up and I am just stuck there. 

What is the name of that?

I have had 2 emotional flashbacks when met with a trigger, these included hyperventilatio, shaking, uncontrollable crying and dissacoiation, but this is different, its this replay with me agitated because I can’t change anything.
If it helps, I think this may be related to the fact that my biggest issue with all that happened is that my agency was taken away.

I am an envious loser with ambition but no drive because I feel that if I put in effort it’s almost certainly a failure because I’m unattractive looking. I’ve said terribly things about women who look like me, while complaining I’m not loved. I’m exhausted with myself, and feel like a lost cause every day. I just recently got a job in the field I want to be in and I’m not even doing a good job at it. I wish I could change but because of what I look like, and because I don’t have money, I feel hopeless.

Even with my therapist, I’m frustrated that he can’t help me with being more attractive to attractive women, and that’s not his job, so I know I’m in the wrong. It’s difficult for me to do it for me alone. I’m dreading my 30th birthday in a year because it’ll mean I’m a 30 year loser virgin who no one woman wants to date or have sex with because I’m unattractive.

I self loathe over my celebrity crush Becky Lynch and say every day I would say things like I hope her husband Seth Rollins gets testicular cancer because I hate him so much, I said the day their daughter was born was the 2nd worst day of my life behind when my mom died. I’m not proud of it and I’m trying to change but my jealousy is crippling. I ruminate every day how I go to bed every night looking at the empty space in my bed knowing that no woman loves me or cares about me or even thinks of me, but the women I’m miserable over lay their heads in the shoulders of the men I hate at night. I even envy my friends because they are happy with beautiful wives. Meanwhile the only 2 advices I get from family and friends are “either date your league with obese women because pretty women won’t ever like you, or go to prostitutes so you won’t be a virgin anymore.” If that’s the best advice people in my life have for me then they really think low of me.",False,False,mentalillness,149342,Controversial,2023,1,Very low,0,226,3117,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

My sister, 19, claims to have anxiety. Me(20) and her both live at home, though she's frequently at her boyfriends. She doesnt oay bills or rent. My dad (43) paid for therapy, and she went to a couple sessions, but whenever me and my dad would go out of town for work, she'd blow it off until we got back and my dad made her go.

However, and this is why I'm skeptical about it, she has no problem going into public if it involves something she wants to do. 6 flags, Renaissance Festival, prom, movies, hanging out with friends in public, she has no problem. Also completely willing to get gas or go to the store if it's for her. 

She won't get a job either due to the anxiety. There's other things that are also raising tension with her, as she's been caught lying frequently recently, but I wanted to focus on the anxiety.

Through all of this we must Pray. We must Pray and continue to Pray for the Only one that Is on the Throne of the World and Our Universe to Heal, Restore and Realign our Humanity. 

Each day this year will be different, the things that are coming will constantly be groundbreaking, will constantly be anxiety, fear, pain, sadness driven, we must Pray and Meditate daily. We have constantly been shown in the past year truly, hoping you have been allowing yourself to open your own eyes ignore your ignorance to know this is not a movie, this is not something to allow the fear to consume and overwhelm you, but to sit, feel and embrace and SPEAK. I understand the privilege I have, we must speak, we must share and we must continue to have these conversations, with all of that in mind as well.........

**WE MUST PRAY AND STAY CLOSE TO GOD AND JESUS.** If we all do then that is the only way that this world can be restored, realigned and move forward with peace and happiness through **UNITY.** We all have different beliefs with ""God"", ""Satan"" etc., but we have been constantly shown who is being exposed with our own two eyes and who is **WORKING**, as we live, as we breathe, as you are reading this. **THE MOST HIGH.** 

If you are asking yourself I want to start connecting with God/Jesus, how do I? Close your eyes, and with your inside voice or external say ""Hi God/Hi Jesus, My name is ........ I just wanted to say Hi"" and you will receive Guidance, Love and Light.

I shouldn't be a father or husband,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"It's a tough pill to swallow. But for some reason when I stop mandating these requirements in my head, I feel like a burden has been lifted. I have too much mental illness and trauma to ever be a good family man. I have anger issues, I have trouble managing my life, depression, anxiety, and ocd just keep me from ever having the normal life I want. I've been medicated since I was 13 and I'm 30 now. My father has just screwed me up beyond repair.

I wouldn't wish a guy like me to marry anyone's daughter or provide for children. When you have kids, i believe you need to be ready financially, physically, and mentally. I need to be able to pull my weight and make hard decisions. I need to have it together. Otherwise I'd be bringing more kids into this world with more damage who didn't even ask to be born. I also can't make a wife as happy as other more mentally healthy men. I've lost out on women I really liked because I believed I wasn't right for them. And it makes me content to know they are with men who make them happy.

Can’t stop spiraling,5,False,False,True,False,1,False,"After years of being unable to get a job or be financially independent or make friends or date due to poor mental health, chronic procrastinating, and compulsive self-soothing online I have finally gotten to a point where my mindset is healthier and I have the motivation to work towards my goals. 

Fast forward to this morning when I woke up to find small red bumps on my body and what small dark spot on my sheet that could be dried blood. 

For context, I had bedbugs about 5 years ago and it was absolutely traumatic. The spots on my body today look very different from the bedbug bites I have in the past - they are tiny red bumps about the size of a tiny whitehead pimple, whereas in the past they’ve been large welts the size of a dime. Still, I have found my entire day has been derailed by this. I am compulsively checking my mattress and posting in bug identification subreddits, and then trying to distract myself through mindless scrolling. I contacted my landlord and they said they would deal with it tomorrow but I know that really means next week. I am in blind panic and can’t think straight or focus and am anticipating a miserable year of trying to get rid of bedbugs and having no social life because I don’t want to leave my house and spread the bedbugs. I don’t want to do any work or apply for jobs, just lay down and watch tv so I am forced not to think about this. 

I need advice for how to live with this fear and function and move forward with a life that may now involve bedbugs, which since 2019 have been one of my worst fears.",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55679,New,2024,2,Low,0,20,1559,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0
What is your experience been like with the diagnostic process?,3,False,False,True,False,3,False,"So, I sort of thought with time, my trauma would get better. I know that’s the sort of the thing that takes time, and it’s fairly normal to have trauma responses for a while after a traumatic event. However, it’s been almost a year now since the event in question and I feel like I’m not getting any better. 

I’m still incredibly avoidant of people, situations, and things that might trigger flashbacks of the event. When I’m not in class I’m basically a recluse, and spend time alone in my room where I’m safe and can’t see the person who is the source of my suffering. When I am triggered, my adrenaline spikes and I’m shaking like a leaf for hours or end up bawling. To cope I end up wandering around at night for hours or on rare occasion I’ll drink since it calms me.

 I’m annoyingly hyper vigilant where I’ll check locks over and over and I used to check the location of the person who caused my trauma so I could be sure to avoid them. The nightmares have been decreasing in frequency, but they’re still troublesome. I’m also more depressed and pessimistic than usual since this all happened. I suppose I’m always depressed but it’s definitely been more noticeable. I feel distrustful and wary of all men, which sucks because I really don’t want to feel that way. Also, when I see the person in question I disassociate. I also now get bursts of anger which I never used to feel.

Anyway, dealing with all this has been rather frustrating. It’s made keeping up with my academics challenging and because I’m so exhausted all the time from being on high alert and my adrenal system freaking out, it’s also thrown a wrench in me searching for a job this semester. The isolating has also hindered my social life. I feel like I’m being held back.

I currently do see a trauma counselor, which is nice I suppose, but I’m beginning to realize I need more support. I’m thinking of scheduling an appointment with a therapist  to figure out what this all is and maybe try a therapy to help it. I’m a bit nervous about it all though because I’ve never undergone any sort of diagnostic process.

What was it like for you all when you sought help and/or diagnosis? And what sort of therapies did you find beneficial?

Advice on best kind of treatment for overcoming binge eating and cannabis habit/addiction,6,True,False,True,False,3,True,"Hey folks, I am looking to pursue some kind of treatment for a binge eating and cannabis problem which I have been dealing with for a long time. I am 28, and have had a terrible relationship with food from as young as I can remember. As young as 6 or 7 I would eat multiple candy bars in a single sitting. I realize now that I always looked for comfort in sugary foods, and my parents unfortunately weren’t really proactive with restricting the amount I could eat. 

At this point I try to eat healthy, but whenever I get stressed I will compulsively binge eat sugary snacks to the point of physical discomfort. I also do this at any occasion or event where there is a lot of food. 

I have also been a daily cannabis user for around ten years, and find it incredibly hard to stop for any significant amount of time. I definitely use it to nurse my mental health, but it has gotten to the point where the cannabis and eating is starting to really harm my health, particularly my gut and dental health.

I have reached out to the eating recover center based in Chicago, and have been offered to join a virtual outpatient program. The problem is, there will be an expectation that I would not smoke cannabis for the duration of the program. The issue here is that the program will not offer me specialized help for managing the sobriety from weed. Also the fact that it is virtual will mean there is nothing to stop me from smoking which I think would be counterproductive to the treatment. 

I am looking for a treatment plan that can cover both my issues with eating and with cannabis. I have undergone a year of cognitive behavioral therapy in the past which was aimed at anxiety, depression, jealousy and insecurity. I found it helpful but my therapist was very green and I felt we became too familiar for me to be as open as I should have been at times.

Other problems I experience include neuroticism, poor anger management, poor impulse control, low self esteem, social anxiety, low motivation, lack of focus, difficulty maintaining friendships, periods of lowered mood, excess guilt and shame and poor organization skills.

I am not hoping for a miracle, but just want to find healthier ways of coping. I strongly believe that making healthier choices for ourselves is one of the keys to a happy life, and want to focus on implementing positive changes to treat myself and others better. 

I live in Los Angeles,  and am open to all forms of treatment.

TLDR; I am eating and smoking myself to ill health and want help beating my addictions and mood problems.

I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution.

New theories recognize depression as part of a biological survival strategy.

Posted Dec 22, 2020

[We’ve Got Depression All Wrong. It’s Trying to Save Us. | Psychology Today UK](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us?fbclid=IwAR03hLdRjNFSxGIygCVxhMsqMb37lPuDejhbW7o0lkMbmCFJ41FqngTDZCM)

For generations, we have seen [depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/depression) as an illness, an unnecessary deviation from normal functioning. It’s an idea that makes sense because depression causes suffering and even death. But what if we’ve got it all wrong? What if depression is not an aberration at all, but an important part of our biological defense system?

More and more researchers across specialties are questioning our current definitions of depression. Biological anthropologists have argued that depression is an [adaptive response to adversity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/shouldstorm/202008/what-if-some-mental-disorders-arent-really-disorders) and not a mental disorder. In October, the British Psychological Society published a [new report](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/freud-fluoxetine/202011/depression-disease-or-experience) on depression, stating that “depression is best thought of as an experience, or set of experiences, rather than as a disease.” And neuroscientists are focusing on the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in depression. According to the [Polyvagal Theory](https://www.polyvagalinstitute.org/) of the ANS, depression is part of a biological defense strategy meant to help us survive.

The common [wisdom](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/wisdom) is that depression starts in the mind with distorted thinking. That leads to ""psychosomatic"" symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, or fatigue. Now, models like the Polyvagal Theory suggest that we’ve got it backward. It’s the body that detects danger and initiates a defense strategy meant to help us survive. That biological strategy is called immobilization, and it manifests in the mind and the body with a set of symptoms we call depression.

When we think of depression as irrational and unnecessary suffering, we stigmatize people and rob them of hope. But when we begin to understand that depression, at least initially, happens for a good reason we lift the [shame](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/embarrassment). People with depression are courageous survivors, not damaged invalids.

Laura believes that depression saved her life. Most of the time her father only hurt her with words, but it was when she stood up to him that Laura’s dad got dangerous. That’s when he’d get that vicious look in his eyes. More than once his violence had put Laura’s life at risk.

Laura’s father was so perceptive, that he could tell when she felt rebellious on the inside even when she was hiding it. And he punished her for those feelings.

It was the depression that helped Laura survive. Depression kept her head down, kept her from resisting, helped her accept the unacceptable. Depression numbed her rebellious feelings. Laura grew up at a time where there was no one to tell, nowhere for her to get help outside her home. Her only strategy was to survive in place. And she did.

Looking back, Laura does not regret her [childhood](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/child-development) depression. She values it. Going through her own healing process and working with her therapist helped her see how depression served her.

Laura’s story is stark. It’s ugly. And it helps us understand that even though depression may happen for a good reason, that does not make it a good thing. Laura suffered deeply and describes the pain of her hopelessness vividly. Her depression was a bad experience that started as the last resort of a good biological system.

Depression Starts with Immobilization

According to the Polyvagal Theory, discovered and articulated by [neuroscientist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/neuroscience) Stephen Porges, our daily experience is based on a hierarchy of states in the autonomic nervous system. When the ANS feels safe, we experience a sense of well-being and social connection. That’s when we feel like ourselves.

But the autonomic nervous system is also constantly scanning our internal and external environment for signs of danger. If our ANS detects a threat or even a simple lack of safety, its next strategy is the fight or flight response which we often feel as [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/anxiety).

Sometimes the threat is so bad or goes on for so long, that the nervous system decides there is no way to fight or to flee. At that point, there is only one option left: immobilization.

The immobilization response is the original biological defense in higher animals. This is the shutdown response we see in reptiles. Also known as the freeze or faint response, immobilization is mediated by the dorsal [vagus nerve](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/vagus-nerve). It turns down the metabolism to a resting state, which often makes people feel faint or sluggish.

Immobilization has an important role. It dulls pain and makes us feel disconnected. Think of a rabbit hanging limply in the fox’s mouth: that rabbit is shutting down so it won’t suffer too badly when the fox eats it. And the immobilization response also has a metabolic effect, slowing the metabolism and switching the body to [ketosis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/ketogenic-diet). Some doctors speculate that this metabolic state could help healing in severe illness.

In humans, people often describe feeling ""out of their bodies"" during [traumatic](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/trauma) events, which has a defensive effect of cushioning the emotional shock. This is important because some things are so terrible, we don’t want people to be fully present when they happen.

So the immobilization response is a key part of the biological defense, but it is ideally designed to be short term. Either the metabolic shut down preserves the organism, i.e. the rabbit gets away, or the organism dies and the fox eats the rabbit.

But if the threat continues indefinitely and there is no way to fight or flee, the immobilization response continues. And since the response also changes brain activity, it impacts how people’s emotions and their ability to solve problems. People feel like they can’t get moving physically or mentally, they feel hopeless and helpless. That’s depression.

Does Depression Have Value?

It’s easy to see why Laura's childhood circumstances would set off the immobilization response, and even how it might have helped her survive. But why does it happen in people with less obvious adversity? Our culture tends to think of depression in the person who finds work too [stressful](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/stress) as a sign of weakness. [Self-help](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/self-help) articles imply that they just need more mental toughness and they could lean in and solve it. Even some therapists tell them that their depression is a distorted perception of circumstances that aren’t so bad.

But that is not how the body sees it. The defense responses in the autonomic nervous system, whether fight/flight or immobilization are not about the actual nature of the trigger. They are about whether this body decides there is a threat. And that happens at a pre-conscious point. The biological threat response starts before we think about it, and then our higher-level brain makes up a story to explain it. We don’t get to choose this response; it happens before we even know it.

Studying anxiety has revealed that many modern circumstances can set off the fight or flight response. For instance, low rumbling noises from construction equipment sound to the nervous system like the growl of a large predator. Better run. Feeling like they are being evaluated at school removes kids' sense of safety and triggers fight-or-flight. Better give the teacher attitude or avoid homework. And to most of us, fight-or=flight feels like anxiety.

Eventually, if these modern triggers last long enough, the body decides it can’t get away. Next comes immobilization which the body triggers to defend us. According to Porges, what we call depression is the cluster of emotional and cognitive symptoms that sits on top of a physiological platform in the immobilization response. It’s a strategy meant to help us survive; the body is trying to save us. Depression happens for a fundamentally good reason.

And that changes everything. When people who are depressed learn that they are not damaged, but have a good biological system that is trying to help them survive, they begin to see themselves differently. After all, depression is notorious for the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. But if depression is an active defense strategy, people may recognize they are not quite so helpless as they thought.

Shifting Out of Immobilization

If depression is the emotional expression of the immobilization response, then the solution is to move out of that state of defense. Porges believes it is not enough to simply remove the threat. Rather, the nervous system has to detect robust signals of safety to bring the social state back online. The best way to do that? Social connection.

One of the symptoms of depression is shame, a sense of having let other people down or being unworthy to be with them. When people are told that depression is an aberration, we are telling them that they are not part of the tribe. They are not right, they don’t belong. That’s when their shame deepens and they avoid social connection. We have cut them off from the path that leads them out of depression.

It is time that we start honoring the courage and strength of depressed people. It is time we start valuing the incredible capacity of our biology to find a way in hard times. And it is time that we stop pretending depressed people are any different than anyone else.",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55678,Top,2021,2,Very high,4,70,10314,positive,negative,False,False,1,1,1

I hate myself so much and it's completely justified,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"For the past few years my self hatred has only gotten worse and worse. The worst part is it's not just in my head. It's completely justified. Every bad thought I have about myself is true. I just don't know how I can live with myself let alone *love* myself. Someone like me absolutely does not deserve to love themselves. Yet I still spend all day bed rotting, playing games, making art and laughing and smiling like I deserve to be happy. When I objectively don't.

For context, I'm about to be 20 in June. I've never had a job. I dropped out of uni because I couldn't bring myself to do assignments and eventually I couldn't bring myself to go to class at all. My mom has been extremely supportive and reassured me that it was okay, she's never pressured me to get a job or anything. All she asks is that I help out around the house. I try my best but it's obviously not enough. God words cannot describe how disgustingly embarrassed I feel just saying this. It's so so gross oh my god. 

It's been increasingly miserable living with myself knowing how privileged I am. I get to have everything I have while there's people out there having to live through such unimaginable pain. The fact I'm ever upset about this is disgusting in and of itself. Of course the privileged spoiled child who's never had any struggles whatsoever needs a pep talk and to be reassured that it's okay. Of course I desperately want someone to tell me it's okay and I'm not completely worthless. But it's not true and I know that for a fact. It's just me once again being disgustingly selfish and just wishing I won't have to stress about it. Because I whine about the *tiniest* thing. I still *dare* ask anything of my mom when she's working all day almost all week and doing chores and everything. I know she loves me so I guess I'm really not better off dead. But god I can't even put into words how much I despise my pathetic worthless existence.

I've always loved art and it's quite literally all I have and I'm not even good at it. I'm completely good for nothing. I'm going to die without having done anything of worth. I also hate acknowledging that I have emotions it's so embarrassing.

I'm so disgustingly spoiled I genuinely can't bring myself to even list off the things my mom has given me and everything she's done for me. While I haven't done a single thing for her. Or for anyone. Ever. There was no point to me being born. I'm really nothing but a useless useless burden.

I hate that I'm even complaining about this. The fact I even *dare* try to make this an issue and to imply I'm a victim in any conceivable way. Once again, it's just me being disgustingly selfish and needing to be comforted about the stupidest thing. I almost wish I'd never been born because then I wouldn't have burdened my family so much and I wouldn't be here feeling this way right now.

I hate it so much and despite all this I still can't bring myself to go study or look for a job or do literally anything. I can't even bypass the absolute *tiniest* obstacle known to man.

Even if I improve, even if I get a job, even if by some miracle I became super successful and could pay my family back for all they've done for me it won't be enough. I feel like I'm inherently less worthy of happiness because I was born in such a caring and loving family. How in the world can I actually live with myself?? I genuinely struggle to think how I can accept my being after so many years of being so selfish and useless

I want to say I want help. I so desperately want to say it's okay and that I deserve to be happy. I so desperately want someone to convince me that I'm not trash. But I know it's objectively not true. As a child I never understood why people hated themselves. And almost always I believed 99% of people's self hatred was completely unjustified. I so deeply wish that was me today. I wish I was just being overly critical of myself, of course I'm so selfish that I wish all of this wasn't true. But all my thoughts of self hatred are completely 100% true and justified. How do you deal with this? How do you deal with knowing you completely deserve to hate yourself? Should I even be asking for advice? Because if people give me advice I might feel better but I know I don't deserve that.

God I just know that I really need to be told to quit whining and get a job but it doesn't help. It's still not gonna work. Nothing I try when I try to get myself to do something works. It never works because I'm just so selfish. I'm sorry and again I know this is selfish but please don't be too harsh on me. I just wanted to let this all out.

People say just to be ""you"" but the thing is I'm not sure who I am. Because to me it all depends. Who I am right now could be different from who I am tomorrow. And moreover I am not *confident* in the person who I am now because I know how little I know, and how ill informed most of my decisions likely are. This is a huge source of depression for me.

On the flip side I feel like people who think they know who they are are ignorant. I believe we are all constantly being changed and affected by the experiences in life and people's personalities change depending on context. And if people try to act the ""same"" thorugh it all it just means they are shutting themselves off, preventing themselves from being sculpted by life.

But is that a bad thing? Should you completely open yourself up to life, and let it sculpt you? What if your life has been traumatic? Should you not let life sculpt you at all, perhaps retain  idealist values and cling tightly to them, maintaining the integrity of the sculpture, making it stand the test of time? Somewhere in the middle maybe? If it is in the middle, what criteria do you use to choose what sculpts you and what doesn't?

**The verdict is I am struggling to develop a healthy relationship with myself.** In one way, I don't want to associate myself with any form of identity because its limiting my growth as a person. On the other hand, I feel like some form of identity is absolutely necessary to a healthy being with a good relationship with oneself. People find other people who have a strong sense of self attractive and fun to be around. While I might've used to be this person, I just can't put so much faith into my self anymore, its so unfinished, so incomplete, I feel pathetic.

Perhaps to find myself I need to revert to my emotional urges and impulses, but I don't want to submit to those really, because they are not much healthier than not having a self. Perhaps I need to make my identity some sort of wanderer, and gain my certainty from the act of wandering and navigating through the eternal grey area that is life.

**I DONT KNOW, and I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN KNOW.**

Someone please give me your thoughts, and thanks.

First of all I want to commemorate anybody who is on disability or has ever been on disability. PTSD is a serious and potentially debilitating diagnosis depending on severity.

In May of 2023, I committed myself to a mental hospital. I was so done with the pain. With the triggers. With living. I did not see a future for myself.

I started weekly EMDR therapy in May, and continue to go now every week, diving into a new trigger or memory every time.

Since my progress with EMDR, being honest with psychiatrists, and not pushing myself above my limit, I have been making plans now to apply to go back and get my Masters Degree in Social Work. 

I also have a pet betta fish that I take care of daily, and he reminds me to take care of myself too.

My focus - that was something difficult to tackle. My mind went everywhere. I felt stupid. Dumb.

But then I started reading.

Reading took my mind away from everything. It wasn’t a drug. But it was an escape. Eventually my logic began to return. All the while I went back to work. Online, for my dad. Not ideal, but work.

I began to reach out to people I haven’t spoken to in years and hang out with them. I thought I would be too much to handle, but in reality everybody commemorated my progress.

I spend a lot of time at home still, but I get outside.

I picked up a new hobby of smelling fragrances, new smells that remind me of my progress.

I journal every night.

I take my medications at the same time every day.

I make sure to eat 3 meals a day.

I help out around the house.

Of course my finances are still not the best, but my finances are still better than they were previously, which is progress.

AITA for letting my groomer flirt with me while I was in a relationship,0,False,False,True,False,1,True,"I already am anticipating that I’m the asshole, but oh well.

**TW: Self-harm, mentions of suicide, and grooming**

**During Relationship**

I (15M) was seeing this girl who was 16. We were in a relationship for about two months and around month one I got drunk and found my groomers (35M) account where I then begged for him to talk to me because I was drunk. And he did, and we talked and we talked until it became a daily habit again like how it was before I cut him off. He would occasionally flirt with me and I would just kinda let it happen because I was too shy to tell him to stop. He would respond or me saying things like “I wish I could be a sexy bartender” with “You would be if you learned to bartend”.

**Pre Relationship**

I never told by girlfriend about me getting in contact with him again because she was actually the one who helped me to stop talking to him. Why did she want me to stop talking to him? Because he got a nude from me while I was suicidal and would regularly praise me for self harm and complain it or me when I showed him pictures of what I did to myself.

**Aftermath**

So pretty recently I broke up with her because of her jealousy and trust issues around me buying drugs or razorblades and she threatened to kill herself saying that there was nothing I could do about it. Once I made sure that she was safe and that she wasn’t going to do anything, I cut her off.

And I was talking to my friend, who we will call Mason, one day during my cutting episodes where there isn’t really much anyone can do to convince me out of doing it and I told him that I “Never wanted to get better”, because I wasn’t in the right headspace. I’ve been working toward bettering myself though.

Then he turned that into me attention seeking and that out whole relationship was fake because of it. And I will be the first to admit that part of it was attention seeking, but most of it was feeling like I genuinely deserved to hurt myself that day. Then he stopped talking to me, called me disgusting, and then my ex came after me this morning after I sent my apology and explanation basically confessing to everything.

The apology/explanation was this: 

“Hey, this is all the contact that I want to have with you because I respect your decision of not wanting to talk to me anymore. All I’m here to do is give a sincere apology and give you the explanation that I owe you, and probably should have given to [Ex girlfriend] as well. And no, this is not me just trying to guilt you or anything like that. I’m just getting all of this out because I feel as if i owe it to you and I do.

First of all, I really, truly do want to get better. Honest. The only reason that I said that is because I was caught up in the moment and wanted you to tell me to cut, which now in a clear state of mind I realize that you would never do. You are a good person, [Mason]. You’re not like the sick person in my life that has been making me want to cut.

And on that note, remember [groomer]? The 35 year old man who groomed me? Well, a month or two ago, one of the times I got drunk, I found his account and begged him to talk to me. And he did. And we talked and we talked, and I’ve been in contact with him ever since. Letting him flirt with me, letting him show me self harm and I would show him some in return. And I would take all those photos I would send and post for him (self harm photos). He’s honestly the reason I started doing it in the first place.

And remember that large cut that I made? The really bad one? He asked me how big I could make it and praised me for it. A lot. And I’m so sorry for not telling you this sooner. I’m sorry for not telling [Ex girlfriend]. I just knew that you would tell me to leave him and I wasn’t ready to do that, I guess.

I’m just really, truly sorry and I wish that I could take it all back. I genuinely loved our friendship and I didn’t just fake it all for your attention, I promise you that. I get plenty of attention from Reddit and Twitter (Which I deleted again). Healthy attention? No, but I didn’t care what kind it was because as much as I don’t want it to be true, I am, like you said, an attention seeker. And the whole “I’m going to cut and there’s nothing you can do to stop me” thing was honestly a mix of attention seeking and a genuine feeling of feeling like I deserved to be hurt. It’s why I never wanted to tell you that I wanted to cut, I didn’t want to act like that around you, and I’m so fucking sorry, [Mason]. I really am.

I have read your second to last response over and over again, thinking about what I’ve done and regretting it.

With all of that being said, I’m honestly and truly sorry for what I did and how I treated you. You tried so hard to get me to put the blade away and I just refused to like a toddler refusing to eat their vegetables. I was childish and attention seeking and I’m sorry for that and everything else that I’ve done.

But one small positive that I want to share is that I’ve downloaded the I Am Sober app, thrown out all of my blades, threw away my suicide note, put the vape back, and on Friday I will be throwing out the duster and returning the alcohol.

I enjoyed our friendship and I’m sorry that it had to end like this. I enjoyed every conversation, I loved that you actually cared for me, and I’m thankful that I even got to have you in my life, [Mason]. I’m sorry for doing this.

Goodbye, [Mason]. I hope that you get away from your family and go to a good college. I believe in you and I wish you well.”

And she came after me saying that I was an abuser, a manipulator, a liar, a freak, that I should burn in hell, and that I was still the kid who would attention seek and manipulate (That last one is more of a personal hit). And then she started spreading the rumor that I was an abuser by sharing private *sexting* messages between me and her where it was a lot of degration and BDSM. She would ASK me to call her things like “Toy”, “worthless”, “slut”, “whore”, “sex toy”, and just a mixture of those mixed with some praise. And she took those screenshots out of context and sent them to Mason, where Mason then tried to convince another friend who we will call Kai, that I was this horrible abusive person.

I convinced Kai that I wasn’t an abuser and all that, but I did end up cutting them off along with pretty much every other person I knew online besides one person who I’ve been friends with for years.

    I used to be a social butterfly when I was a kid. That is until middle school... I skipped 3rd grade and went to a small private Christian school for 4th and 5th grade.

Skip ahead but these past few weeks me and my roommate have been really close! We're talking more and she's been inviting me to go on her occasional morning walks (she knows I love walking in the afternoon).

Skip ahead, there was an event happening in our dorm hall and me, her, and my other roommates, go to. It was super awkward for me bc I'm not rlly close to the other too but that doesn't matter. After the event, me and her were lowkey hungry so we wanted to go to a restaurant which was pretty far.

So what was meant to be a quick walk to this restaurant turned into a 6 hour night walk around our area!! We were literally walking and talking and exploring but I felt so happy it was great :D

My therapist is becoming more masculine and it is triggering and making me feel less safe,0,True,False,True,False,3,False,"My therapist is becoming more masculine and it is triggering and making me feel less safe 

I don’t feel safe around men and I definitely did not want a male therapist. When I first met my therapist, they identified as she/her/hers and presented more feminine as they wore their hair long. I also felt like their personality was more bubbly and feminine when I met them or maybe because they presented more feminine I felt that way? 

Now they identify as they/they, act less bubbly/warm and more masculine, wear their hair short and dress more masculine. They do not identify as a man so they are not trans but I think they are queer and non-binary. I am noticing I am becoming triggered by my therapist. I do not feel safe around masculinity, male presenting people, and/or people who may be attracted to me. When they act more masculine, I get triggered especially now because I feel they are dressing more masculine. 

This sucks. My therapist is so great and has been helpful so far (the past 6 months).. but now I am questioning if we are the right fit. I was looking for a nurturing feminine motherly presence to help me heal my CPTSD.

I feel bad about offending them, I told them it felt uncomfortable to bring this up because I did not want to offend them since it was about their identity. They told me they wonder if my discomfort around them has to do with me not being comfortable with my own repressed masculine energy as they think my authentic self has some masculine strong qualities to it. That made me wonder a bit if that was going on... plus also because I am questioning my sexuality—wondering if I am bisexual. But I still don’t really think that is it..... I really think they are triggering me because of their male presentation and masculinity. A couple weeks ago, I felt like they were mad/irritated with me so I did what I normally do to other men: flirt with them because I feared their anger!!! Also sometimes I get confused because I feel I am attracted to them because they are presenting more masculine a-times. I also have worried about them sexualizing me as I know they are also into women in the past. Not so much now but definitely in the beginning. 
I did tell them how I felt. They said they have more masculine energy but they also have feminine energy.. they said they understand I want a mom but they can offer me both a mom (feminine energy) and dad (masculine energy) depending on their energy in the moment. 


Anyone else struggle with this? I am wondering if I should stay as we are so compatible in other ways and also because it may be healing to have someone with masculine energy treat me well?? Plus they are helping me become more feministic and breaking free from socialization. What do you think about them turning it back on me by saying I could be reacting towards them due to my own repressed masculinity? Should I try to find a feminine and motherly therapist?

I am also worried because I tend to do this pattern of finding flaws in my relationships/therapists as we get closer because of my fear of intimacy and distance (reactive/disorganized attachment) so I hope that is not what is going on here.. recently I’ve been wondering if they really care about me.",False,False,ptsd,100207,Controversial,2020,2,Very high,0,89,3223,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0

"Does this ""count"" as trauma, and how do I move forward from here?",0,False,False,True,False,3,False,"My dad cheated on my mom when I was very young, and they divorced when I was around 4 or 5. I've lived with my mom and stepdad since then, and I never really thought about it or talked about it with my mom or dad (I didn't know what happened why my mom hated my stepmom so much until I was around 14 or 15).

Due to some circumstances, I now have to live with my dad and stepmom, and my two half sisters. I adore my sisters-- they're delightful, innocent children, and I love taking care of them, playing with them, driving them to their activities, etc. 

The problem lies with how to interact with my dad and stepmom. I've only recently begun to feel this deep seated hatred (hate is a strong word, but) and grudge toward them which never bothered me before when I was a kid/teenager. Cheating is one of the worst offenses in my book, especially if you're married and with children. I absolutely cannot fathom how anyone can leave their children for their own selfish desires.

I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anorexia, and anxiety and have struggled with them for about 5-6 years now, to the point of being hospitalized a couple times for eating disorder issues as well as suicidal ideation, and I currently can't attend uni or hold a job because my anxiety is so bad. My therapist hinted that a lot of my anxiety issues come from fear of being abandoned and given up on, which comes from child me interpreting my dad leaving as him abandoning me, which is not farfetched tbh.

My dad and stepmom act fine to me, but I'm starting to find it difficult to even act civil toward them now. I have this assumption that my stepmom resents me because her children like me, and I act like a parent to them. I'm very fortunate that my family is fine financially, and no one is pressuring me to go back to school or get a job. My therapist thinks that I'm not ready yet.

On the other hand, although I feel generally content here taking care of my sisters, I can't help this feeling of being unsettled, plus the negative emotions that come up around my dad and stepmom. Plus, it feels like I'm the only one who's still concerned about it-- my mom, who is an incredibly strong and amazing person, has somehow persevered through it all, and my older brother has graduated uni and gotten married to an amazing girl. 

I'm having a lot of difficulty finding forgiveness within me, especially since the whole divorce shebang, neglect, and along with my general personality might have paved the way for all the mental illness issues I deal with now. On top of that, I can't even begin to imagine the grief it caused my mother; plus, she had to raise my brother and me as a single mom working full time for several years before she met my stepdad. 

Anyway, yeah. I just don't know what to do from here. I see a therapist 1-2 times a week, and she is very kind and thoughtful and listens to everything I have to say, but doesn't provide a lot of concrete advice, just telling me things along the line of ""only time will heal these wounds"" and to basically go easy on myself and take care of myself.

I feel like I don't even want to mend the relationship with my dad because there's absolutely nothing he can do to make it up to me (and my mom and my brother for that matter). I've considered going back to school to get an associate's degree, and then finding a job that pays enough for me to live on my own, but that in itself is such a daunting task. In the meantime, I'm just trying to avoid my dad and stepmom as much as possible, and I try to do what they say and take care of my sisters as well.

Blarg, sorry for the wall of text-- didn't intend for it to be this long. Any responses or even just a listening ear are greatly appreciated. I didn't know where to post this since it doesn't seem like it fits neatly into any one category of mental health. Plus I've been lurking around here for a while and reading some of the resources, and the things about CPTSD really hit home with me, even if what I experienced doesn't actually ""count"" as trauma or PTSD.

Tips when a partner has made mentioning therapy/resources a boundary?,3,True,False,True,False,4,False,"My partner of almost 3 years has CPTSD. Last year they broke up with me for awhile after several months of… I don’t even know what term you would use. They were in a rough spot, simple things could turn into one sided arguments that followed a very specific pattern. 
That pattern goes as follows. Simple discussion, something in it becomes a sticking point which takes awhile to realize, by this point my words are rearranged to be taken in the worst possible light (by rearranged I mean sentences 10 minutes apart can become one) Even if I convince them that that was not what I said they would pivot to something else. I would ask to exit, they would say they’ve been wanting to exit the whole time, then continue. If I say anything that could be construed as judgmental or not responding perfectly, it will then be used against me and made into the thing we had been arguing about the entire time (even though chronologically it was said 45 minutes in) I would burn out, it was like they hated me and it could start from anything.

It started over a year into our relationship, went on for enough months where I was in a bad mental space and barely functioning (and my lessened ability became proof I was not a good partner) The one time I argued back they broke up with me. The behavior went ”back to normal” after that and they worked to reconnect with me. 4 months of that (and me in therapy) we decided to get back together, with the agreement that she would start DBT + therapy and we would have hard conversations when we needed to, even if the other person hated it.

It’s been over a year since then, things have been great though they never got into therapy or started DBT.

Last night we had our first instance of that pattern coming back, it was very triggering. After spending a day by myself, journaling and pieces thoughts together I realized they had picked at every one of my vulnerabilities in a subtle enough way where I didn’t even notice. I just knew it went too far when I was in tears and nonverbal for 45 minutes.

But I stuck with it to have the hard conversation, I’ve been in great mental health and knew what to expect, and I’ve had a good amount of therapy about this sort of thing. I tried to point out the pattern, they did not believe me (they always have a justification and are very convinced they are right when this happens) I pivoted to point out that our realities are not currently lined up, it could be me who is wrong but we are not experiencing the same conversation. I was careful with not bringing up mental health. Eventually it led to them wanting to take the relationship to the next step. I said DBT was still a requirement, this did not go well. They said not to mention it for at least 6 months and used me “blaming everything on mental illness” as a hurtful low blow (which I did not do) I should have excused myself earlier, I thought I could handle it but it had an impact.

Last night could have been a one off but I’m very shaken. I can’t do this again without the tools for us to communicate when things get dark for them. I know they are suffering and I want to be there for them, I’m just not equipped to be the enemy anymore.

But mentioning those tools is a no go. I guess I’m looking for tips on how you’d recommend making that requirement clear in a compassionate manner that will not be taken as an attempt at gaslighting or being cruel. Outside of those months of this behavior things have been the best, I knew it would likely start up again at some point and I feel more equipped, but we still don’t have those tools.

TLDR my partner and I need tools to communicate during the hard times, we agreed to them, but now mentioning them is a boundary and things are getting rough again.",False,False,ptsd,100208,New,2024,2,Very low,1,69,3751,neutral,negative,False,False,0,0,0

taking bipolar meds worsened my depression for 11 years,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"From ages 10-30 I (33F) thought about killing myself every single day (they didn’t stop at 30, just stopped being every day). In 2013 I had my first breakdown as an adult. I was diagnosed with bipolar and started taking medication for it. The medication made things “better” but never “good”. Over the years, my dose increased and meds were added and I was at or near the max dose for everything, Wellbutrin, Risperdal, Buspar, & Lamictal. I have had 3 different psych providers over those years. The most recent I started seeing maybe 3 years ago. She’s always been uncomfortable with how many medications I’m on (also Adderall and Ambien) and how high the doses are. She didn’t want to mess with them much though because she didn’t really have background on my original diagnosis or what my situation was like pre-treatment. Honestly, I have a really poor memory and can’t relay much about that time well. She was especially concerned because my meds were not working for me.

Over the last couple years it took a real dive. This last summer I had to take 5 weeks FMLA off work because I was constantly bursting into tears throughout the day, just sobbing for like an hour at a time. I could not get any work done. I would have taken longer, but after 5 weeks salary continuation drops to 70%. I was a little better after that for a while. Not working really helped (my work was very stressful and I was constantly paranoid about losing my job over the poor performance due to my mental health). And I did all the things my therapist said I should do.

But then it got worse again. Really terrible. The only thing that kept me alive was when my daughter (8F) said to me that her greatest fear was one of her parents dying. I just couldn’t bring myself to be a part of making her greatest fear a reality. Even then it was hard, and I thought I just need to make it to Christmas for my kids.

Well earlier in the year a friend of mine had his own mental health crisis. His depression was medication resistant and he ended up doing TMS & ketamine. He recommended this to me when I talked about what I was going through. He said that he didn’t even realize how sad he was until he started to get better doing TMS. So I made an appointment. The earliest I could get was in mid January. I figured if I could stay alive until Christmas, I could stay alive until then. When my appointment came I was disappointed to hear that TMS was contraindicated for bipolar, and could worsen hypomania/mania. The doctor said that insurance wouldn’t cover it and she wasn’t comfortable doing it, but she could probably find someone else at her practice that would do it and I could pay out of pocket. The cost would be $11,000 (TMS only, not including ketamine).

Now to go back a bit, in 2021 I was diagnosed with autism. Then in maybe September of last year, I learned that it was common for autistic people to be misdiagnosed with bipolar.

I was so desperate to get this treatment. Nothing worked and I just wanted to want to live. So I started to look more into misdiagnosis, and I found five different people online saying that my psychiatrist who diagnosed me had misdiagnosed them with bipolar. I decided to talk to my psych provider about it. She was skeptical mainly because she wasnt the one that diagnosed me, but with her existing concerns about me being over medicated, she was supportive. We decided to titrate me off the Risperdal and Lamictal, one at a time, starting with the Risperdal. I cut my dose in half for a week, then stopped taking it.

A week after I stopped things started getting better. I stopped crying every single night. I was motivated at work and even enjoyed it for the first time in years. I was able to enjoy little moments again, and especially time with my kids. (My spouse and I are separated and previously seeing my kids would just make me sad because all I could think about is how I don’t see them every morning and tuck them in every night.) I’ve been working 12 hour days most days for the last few weeks. I’m exhausted at night, but have no complaints. I’m enjoying it and want to do it, where as before I would put in as little time as possible, starting late, leaving early, checking out in the middle of the day.

I don’t feel hypomanic or even happy. I feel *functional*. Which is amazing. I’m still struggling. My apartment is always a mess, I never want to go anywhere and I have a hard time with hygiene (which is really embarrassing, but with how rarely I leave the apartment at least there’s not that many people to notice it). I still get sad, but now I can get sad without sobbing over it for an hour or more (most of the time). Last night was the only night I spent sobbing like that since I stopped the Risperdal, and that was because it was my first Valentine’s day after breaking off a near 2 year relationship in December. Which I think is a normal thing to happen?

I’m looking forward to what things will be like once I’m off the Lamictal. I have a follow up with my provider next week when I’ll start titrating.

But with the huge difference getting off the Risperdal has made, while I’m grateful and hopeful, I’m also really mad and sad that I’ve been poisoning myself into deeper depression twice a day for the last 11 years at the direction of the people who I trusted to help me.",False,False,mentalhealth,443570,Hot,2024,2,Medium,0,55,5332,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

I don't feel like the world is against me or trying to drag me down or wants me to fail. In fact I feel like the world wants me to win. I have an amazing family, good friends and an incredibly caring girlfriend. 

It's this feeling of knowing that I have the potential to do good and be someone successful, and it's not even out of reach. I know that if I just put in effort and tried I could do it. But I can't. I don't know if it's because somewhere deep down I don't want to succeed or what. 

Like right now the thought of dying is so peaceful, but I know that's not an option yet. It's like if someone were to ask me if I wanted to die I would answer ""No, being alive is a gift and I'm happy that I'm alive"" But I'm not at the same time. It's hard being alive knowing that people believe in me and want me to succeed. 

It would be so much easier if everyone thought I wouldn't ever accomplish anything and gave me reasons to quit. I have only positive and happy people surrounding me and I love it and I hate it at the same time.

Stop believing in me and let me fail. But at the same time keep believing in me because I want to succeed and I know that I can. I love that you believe in me and I hate it at the same time. 

It's this feeling of I don't deserve the blessed life I was given and I wish I could give it to someone who deserves it more than me, but I know that I can live up to my potential. 

I think that it's mostly anger really. I'm mad that I know that I can do it if I apply myself, but I'm holding myself back and I know it. ""Why try so hard? It's difficult, stop. In fact, let's just not try at all. It's easier that way."" And I hate that I think like that and I don't at the same time.

3 fundamental ideas to change your life,1,True,False,True,False,0,False,"Idea #1: You are fully responsible for your life so take complete responsibility.

I want to start from a fundamental and undeniable truth that is that we’re all going to die. Which means that our time, energy and attention on this earth is limited and the burden of spending that time, energy and attention is solely on you and no one else. I know this sounds so stupidly obvious but it’s something I didn’t fully understand and accept. 

As a child you have no responsibilities but as you grow older the responsibilities pile up and eventually when you’re an adult you are all on your own and responsible for yourself. Every good and bad decision and the consequences of those decisions are something you will deal with. Now you can either swallow that hard pill and take control of your life or you can deny and live life passively like I was. 

Once you decide to take full responsibility, the best way to honor that is through being productive and I think of productivity in three parts: Choices, Planning and Action. Because our time on this earth is finite, that means that we must choose what we commit to and what we reject. Basically, prioritization. Your priorities give you direction but direction is useless without planning and action. As they say, failing to plan is planning to fail. Planning is a great thing but we all know plans go sideways when you start to take action which leads me to my next fundamental idea.

Idea #2: Pain is unavoidable so choose the pain you want to endure.

This idea also starts from a fundamental and undeniable truth that is that life is full of pain but we have the choice what kind of pain that we want. We should chase the good pain in life and minimize the bad pain as much as possible. What is good pain and bad pain? 

A simple example is exercise. Exercising for an hour is painful so we avoid it but 30 years down the line when we have major health problems that is also painful so what I’m proposing is that we choose the pain of the exercise so later down the line we don’t feel the pain that comes from living an unhealthy life. There are many other examples but you get the point. 

Choosing the pain we want in our life paradoxically makes it hurt less. If I pointed a gun to your head and told you to run 10 miles you would hate your life but if you chose to train for a 10k and complete it you would feel exhilarated. The pain of running hasn’t changed but the fact you chose the pain makes it hurt less and actually makes you feel good paradoxically. 

The advanced version of this concept is that we should strive to turn something that we find painful into something that we enjoy. People who workout consistently, if you ask them how they do it, they’ll tell you that they enjoy it. You cannot stick to something that you hate, you will eventually stop doing whatever you’re doing but if you make the pain enjoyable and turn it into a part of you and your identity and enjoy the pain then you will be in it for the long run. There is nothing in this world that doesn’t have a downside to it.

Idea #3: Learn how to learn.

This idea is very simple but how many of us really know how to learn? I know I don’t and it is something I’m working towards learning. Learning is a fundamental part of growth and improvement and is something that everyone does until the day they die. The happiest and most successful people in the world have tons of skills and it ties back to idea #1. We don’t have a lot of time in this world. Learning how to learn helps save time and it is a fundamental thing to master and help you make the most of your limited time on this earth.

Met an amazing mom!!,15,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I have manic depression, or bi polar.

I work in finance/ banking, and met a woman recently who literally broke down at my desk when I asked about her grown children. 
Her son was a graduate and living at home still because of a mental break a couple years prior, after college. He was diagnosed with quite a few things (I won’t name here, for anonymity). But she just broke. She told me everything, and how hard it was for her, and how she didn’t know how to give him the encouragement he needed to know he could live life anyways. 
At first, I was being professional (I gave her a hug) and I just listened, but she kept going on and on about how she loved her son and saw so much potential in him, but the PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER WORK OR LIVE A NORMAL LIFE! This infuriated me, and 10 seconds later he walks in. Seemingly normal young man, asked me for some coffee, and told his mom he was gonna head back to the car. I’m even madder now at the doctors. 
So I end up closing my office door, and I told her quietly I had a mental illness, and I have a successful career, a family, because I decided not to let it define me. It’s like cancer, you didn’t choose it, and as long as you take your medicine and see your doctor, it can’t take your life. She bawled more, 
Her son apparently had been recently put on the right medication, and was eager to start working again. I asked what he majored in- turns out it was the same major as my brother. 
We talked more, and I told her she rocked as a mama because she tried to understand her sons Illness and help him instead of shaming him. 

Long story short: I contacted my brother and asked if he needed any help where he was. They need help. Connected the two, and he will hopefully start working in his field soon. God is pretty good at connecting people.

Also, I can’t believe a doctor could be so dense. 
We are people too. Mental illness sucks. I have good and bad days and all that in between.

Anxiety Spiral - Advice Needed! ,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi all, I'm a 26M guy who has been dealing with panic and anxiety for a large majority of my life. My anxiety and panic were evident early on in elementary school with separation anxiety from my mom and an intense fear of fires, to the point where things like fire alarms would send me into a panic. 

It became more disordered in 8th grade since I started developing GERD and the symptoms included chest pain/tightness, and my health anxiety spiked and stayed elevated. During this episode I started with a psychiatrist and began Prozac, which seemed to work well for me. 

Fast forward to me being 21, I'd been stable on Prozac for multiple years and I brought on a panic attack from smoking too much weed one time. The heightened anxiety state persisted and the derealization and loss of appetite quickly followed. I lived far away from my parents at that time but stayed with my partner for a couple nights and ultimately was forced to move back to my apartment and continue with work. It was a really difficult period of my life but I think the routine of going to work everyday really helped instill some normalcy. 

Fast forward to 5 years later (now). I've been doing so well that over the past few months my psychiatrist and I have tried weaning me off of my Prozac, which was a little rocky but I was noticing some of the pros I was hoping to achieve (feeling more positive emotions, being able to cry, sexual function). This past January I was completely off Prozac. Then I got a cold that turned into an ear infection that muted like 80% of my hearing in my left ear, and my health anxiety spiraled. The antibiotics have treated the ear infection, but even with it gone I'm stuck in this increased anxiety state. The past week I've hardly been able to eat, and I'm experiencing the whole nine yards of ""what if's"" and intrusive thoughts. My parents recently moved near me a few months ago, and with me unable to nourish myself right now I've moved in with them for support. 

The problem I'm facing this time is that while in the past I've had work or a routine to distract myself, this time around I don't have much to do. I'm in school but this semester is extremely lowkey compared to past semesters, so I don't have that routine to depend on. It's been really great being with my parents for that support, but I feel myself developing a dependency and that in itself is stressing me out. A couple days ago I tried going back to my apartment for the night, but spiraled drastically. I find myself fearing being alone, because I don't know how to spend my alone time, which I have a lot of. Mornings have been extremely tough since I've been waking up at 6am and unable to fall back asleep, and instead laying in bed for an hour ruminating on thoughts. 

I've been trying to do some things to help myself. I've been getting back into meditation, I've started back on 20mg Prozac with my psychiatrist's advice, I had a session with my therapist where we started developing family systems with my intrusive thoughts, and I've been reading a book called ""Dare"" by Barry Mcdonagh that I've seen on a few threads. 

I guess my big fear right now is if I'm creating a dependent state I won't be able to escape from. Being with my parents brings me comfort and makes it a little easier to feed myself and take care of myself, but the thought of moving back into my apartment is poking in the back of my brain. 

Does anyone have any advice? I just don't know what to do to fill my time and distract myself from the anxious thoughts and feelings, and I'm so afraid of going back to my apartment and spiraling again.",False,False,Anxiety,661126,Hot,2024,2,Very high,0,32,3621,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Say F**K it to a book deal,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Taken from Marianne Power's 'Help Me! Blog' - A book a month - followed to the letter: A year-long quest to see if self help can REALLY change your life.

helpmeblog.net

A couple of months ago I said F**K It to something quite major and I didn’t tell you about it because I worried I’d made a big mistake. I was worried that it was a sure sign that self-help had made me crazy.

In April I was offered a book deal and I turned it down.

I was offered something that I’ve dreamt of my whole life and said ‘No, thanks.’


The offer came when I’d just got back from my uncle’s funeral. My lovely five star hot shot agent called me just after I’d got off an overnight ferry from Ireland and instead of thinking ‘Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god’ I just thought: ‘Oh.’

I put my apathy down to sadness but when I was sitting in the conference room of the big publishing house, a couple of weeks later, I felt exactly the same.

There I was having a meeting with a real life book editor who was saying nice things to me and offering me coffee and croissants, and instead of wanting to jump for joy it all felt wrong.

The publishers had ideas about what should and shouldn’t be put on the blog and how much publicity I could or couldn’t do around it – and even though everything they said was perfectly reasonable, it didn’t feel right.

I didn’t want anybody telling me what I could or couldn’t do – it seemed to go against the whole idea behind this project. I didn’t want this – whatever ‘this’ is – to belong to anybody else but me.

Around the same time I was also approached by a few television people who were interested in doing documentaries on the project. I had fancy meetings in fancy places and it was all great for the ego but my feeling after every meeting was ‘No’.

And so I said ‘No’ to everything and then tumbled into a spiral of self-doubt.

I was proud of myself for having the guts to follow my, well, gut – but I worried that I was crazy too. I’m broke and here are people offering me money – not mega bucks but good bucks – and I’m passing on it. I’ve always wanted to write a book and this was a big, reputable publishing house saying ‘yes, write a book for us!’ and I’ve gone, ‘no, ta.’

What I was doing made no sense, rationally.

Then I did F**K it last week and for the first time in ages I absolutely trust what I’m doing.

Unsurprisingly trusting your gut is big in F**K It land.

In Urbino we had a lot of conversations about why we strive for the things we strive for.

We want the big job because we hope it’ll make us feel better about ourselves. We want more money because it’ll let us buy nicer clothes and a bigger house, which in turn, we hope will make us feel better about ourselves. We want to impress others because we think that if other people like us enough, we’ll feel better about ourselves. But then we get to where we thought we wanted to be, that place we thought we’d feel good about ourselves and there’s still a hole and so we push ourselves more and more.

And on we go forever.

The truth is – and this is such a cliché it’s ridiculous – we have all we need to be happy right now. No matter what kind of situation we are in.

I was thinking about why I wanted a book deal in the first place – and basically it’s status, prestige and ego. I want to be able to tell people that I’ve written a book and I want them to be impressed. I want to tell myself that I have written a book and be impressed. I wanted the outside validation that what I’m doing is good. That I’m good. Enough.

But ultimately that’s bull. Good enough for what and for who? And who cares? The reality is that I’m getting up and writing every day and doing something I love (well, some days I struggle but that’s life). It doesn’t need to be a book or a film to be worthwhile.

Since starting this project my life been more weird, wonderful, moving, challenging, hard, fun, random and gorgeous than I could have expected. I’ve been having conversations and experiences I would never have imagined. I’m getting lovely messages from lovely people (thank you).

This is it – I don’t need anything else.

It goes back to that comment I made to my friend Rebecca when the whole talk of a book deal came up in February. I got all excited that the book would be made into a film and I’d be filthy rich and fantastic. ‘Imagine how much fun we’ll have!” I said to Rebecca while googling ‘LA beach house’. Rebecca’s answer will always stay with me: ‘But we’re already having fun, aren’t we?’

We were and we are. I am.

In Italy we were each asked to pick a tarot card type thing from a deck. I usually hate this kind of crap but the one I picked out seemed so perfect it gave me a shiver.

It was called Moment to Moment and this is what it said: ‘You can be in the present only if you are not ambitious – no accomplishments, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment because all ambition leads you to the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present.’

And so here I am turning my back on ambition, on the things that make financial and professional sense. It’s scary. My life feels in free fall (just to be dramatic about it) but so be it.

John and Gaia say we have to trust the world is on our side and realise that we’re never really in control anyway. They say that when we let go good things happen. As soon as you let go of the wanting, planning and controlling, things fall into place. Amazing stuff that you could never have predicted or imagined can happen.

And yesterday their point seemed to be proved. I met with my lovely five star hot shot who told me I’ve been offered a book deal in Brazil. how random is that?! They aren’t worried about what I do on the blog over the rest of the year they just love the idea and want the book. So there you go. I’m going to be big in Brazil. Maybe.

Nothing’s signed yet, so no doubt things can fall through but just the very idea of a Brazilian book deal has tickled me pink.

I’m now googling ‘beach house Rio’ and going on a crash diet. Only joking. I’m sitting in my sister’s house in East London, drinking tea, listening to Stevie Wonder on the radio and looking at the roses in her garden. All is well, book deal or no book deal.

Healing denial?,3,False,False,True,False,5,False,"

Hiya

How do we move past denial and into healing. 
 This only comes up because in therapy yesterdat we have had to change modality again and im a little frustrated about it. 

We tried going in with flash technique/EMDR but this is too much for my system at the moment. Then we went with IFS approach which is helping as i am connecting to different parts but we have found a block in one of my parts so we are going to try EFT tapping to regulate my nervous system. 

My therapist thinks that the part of me thats blocking is terrified to feel big emotions because its not safe. 

This leads me to my question, my brain os telling me that 'nothing bad happened' but therapy is teaching me 'your brain is blocking and protecting for a reason' 

Theres a missmatch in my feelings here and i don't know how to resolve it apart from sorting out the denial as much as i can. 

So how do i menage denial?

"Energy can be locked in the body in many different ways. It can be locked in on a mental, physical, emotional, spiritual level, or in any combination of these levels.",0,True,False,True,False,2,False,"

On a physical level, the body absorbs and retains chemicals and unresolved emotions in the cells, muscles, bones and organs. On a mental and emotional level, there are times when memories and emotions which were either suppressed or forgotten are re-experienced and remembered as an individual is receiving a healing. 

If you accept that the body, mind and spirit of a person are always seeking a return to wholeness, it is easier to understand how your own healing Spiritual energy can assist you in triggering and releasing these blockages. 

Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

This energy provided in a healing session can release trauma locked in the body from accidents, abuse, fear, or loss of a family member or pet.

Consciously manipulating your own Spiritual chills to heal has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.

Been a ‘lurker’ of Reddit for years. Reading threads but never reacting. 

So, heres my first toe in the water. Attached below is a little note I wrote the other day. Im not sure what it is really, but its a slightly humorous look at depression and anxiety.

Let me know your thoughts. 

‘Welcome Aboard the Magical Misery Cycle.’

Some of you may know me as Cortisol
You’ll see this is a tandem bicycle.
Theres plenty of room for everyone. 
But just to make sure, all those with anxiety, you get on first, at the front, so you can pedal away frantically and see everything that may be in front of you. 
Those with depression you get on behind. This gives you time to muster some motivation and means we can feel the crippling guilt from watching those with anxiety doing all the work. Whilst we sit in self loathing. 
Mixes of both illnesses you’ll fill the gap in the middle. Don’t worry, it seems like there isn’t enough room, some of those with anxiety will get off at the last moment in a manic panic and some of those with depression will follow, crawling back into bed. This leaves those of us who are classed as functional to pedal round on this grey half empty bike dealing with the world around us. Make sure to put your mask on so the onlookers cant see your feelings. Rite. Lets get on with it. Have you taken your meds?

I'm [21M] afraid that I might become attracted to my sister [25F],2,False,False,True,False,32,True,"Background information: My sister and I were always close to one another. She has always helped me with school and, without her, I don't think I would be where I am now. I owe her a lot. If you would have asked my honest opinion about what I think she looks like, I think she is good looking. As for me, I never had a girlfriend, but it was because I'm anxious about dating.

But, for the last few months, I've started to ask myself if I'm sexually attracted to her and I've been noticing some stuff that makes me uncomfortable and I want some answers.

So, everything I'm describing happens only when she is with me. I never felt any of these things when she wasn't with me. 

I remember when I was younger that sometimes I noticed my sister was beautiful, but it never went further than that. I just told myself ""she looks nice... so anyway..."". But since last summer I've asked myself if my appreciation comes from a place of desire to have sex with her. And, since then, I started to get more anxious when she was around.

So, a basic rundown would be like this: when she comes to my apartment to help me clean, bring me groceries, etc., the moment I see her, I start to notice that she is in front of me, and then a shit show happens in my head telling me that I might feel attracted, but it makes me uncomfortable and the overall view doesn't make me feel good like it would do with other girls, but it makes me feel bad and disgusted. I hate when she moves around the house. I always check her body just to be sure I do not feel attracted. And I, really, really hate when she sits right next to me. When that happens, not only do I notice her body, but I also have constant thoughts about me kissing her, or touching her. And it's extremely disgusting. I notice her lips, her legs, etc. and I have these involuntary thoughts about touching her. I don't want to do those things, yet I have intrusive thoughts. 

As for interactions, I started to hate every physical contact like hugging. I agree she does have soft and delicate hands, but thinking that this opinion might mean that I'm sexually attracted, always makes me want to skip any physical contact as fast as possible. As soon as she touches me, I pull myself as quickly as possible. Now, I said that it usually never happens when she isn't around. I can talk with her on the phone easily. But if she is saying something that I would find erotic coming from another girl, it always strikes me, but then I think ""why it always has to be like this?"".

As for some isolated cases, if she bends down, I immediately feel awkward and have unwanted images of blowjobs. Also, last summer we were at the beach and I always avoided looking at her. I hate every time I notice something that I would find erotic if it was done by other girls. I'm sick of it!

I never fantasize about her, and even when I try to do it just to be sure I don't want to do it with her, I don't feel anything. Every interaction that I imagine is uncomfortable. 

She is now dating and I do not feel envy at all. 

I fucking hate myself! That would ruin my relationship with her! I always thought that I'm a good little brother that loves her and wants to protect her. But now I feel like someone that has to be far from her. I want to end all of that. I've been talking about this with other people online, and they think that this might be OCD. But, at this point, I'm not sure. At this point, my intrusive thought evolved from me being distressed, into being annoyed.

I think I’m depressed ,3,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello! 
I am a 22F! I turn 23 next month. I think I am depressed. I think I’ve been depressed for about a year now; but it’s been really bad recently. I think I’ve been avoiding the word depression and accepting that I may have it; but I feel like a classic case now. Here’s some background;

For the past two years, after a bad marijuana episode, I’ve been stuck in an off and on brain fog/ DPDR  stage; my cognitive abilities have declined; and I feel mentally so bleh. Recently it’s been getting better with more “good days” but I still feel not the same. 

I also lost about 30 pounds 2-3 years ago. 2021-2022 were great years. I gained the 30+ pounds back in end 2022-2023 and haven’t lost them since; I’ve been very hyper focused on getting back to how I looked; I hate looking in the mirror; none of my clothes fit me anymore; I feel large and fat. I also have really bad allergies to my cats too that I’m trying to manage. 

I’ve been in a relationship with a man for a year now. In that year span; he has lied to me a few times; and emotionally, not physically cheated on me 1.5 ish times. He broke my trust completely; I trust him a little; and then recently he shattered it again. I love him but I feel numb towards him now. It’s hard with everything else I’m going through but I told him I’d give him a second chance. We’ve gone through a lot but I see him trying; it’s hard though because I know deep down I deserve a love that doesn’t HAVE this many ups and downs… + we’re long distance now (have been for about 5 months) but it’s hard to leave him. 

My sleeps really messed up. I stay up till hours like this; 3-4am. For no reason. And pay the price the next day. I have no type of disipline or motivation for anything. I want to stay home all day. I haven’t reached out or seems my friends in months. Everytime I try I just want to go home. I hate how my clothes look and just feel anxious. I can’t stick to calorie counting.. gym… anything fr. 

I feel constantly dissociated. Numb. Tired. I sleep till noon 1pm. I barely leave the house. I feel disconnected with my best friends; I’ve gone through some shit recently I don’t feel comfortable telling them + I know they don’t like my man so our relationship has just.. been weird. 

Oh I’m also in school. I’ve failed the same class 4 times. It’s my last time taking it. It’s the last class I need to graduate. That’s also driving me nuts! 

I’m very self aware; I’d like help getting out this funk. I’ve tried 2 therapist but my insurance sucks and the experience sucked. They had me seeing them once every MONTH and one even told me “you seem to function well you can’t be depressed!”

Any advice? Where to start? I want to get out of this funk. I’d like to avoid medication for now. ",False,False,depression,1007655,New,2024,2,Medium,0,22,2754,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Question about Exposure Therapy for anxiety of eating and breathing,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"For years I have had anxiety centered around dying or getting panic attack - either via eating going bad (fear of choking and dying) or over-sensing my body  and becoming very anxious, difficulty breathing, too high heart rate (fear of panic attack/dying/fainting). Sometimes it was better, sometimes worse.

I have been doing exposure therapy for the last couple of months with small progress. However my therapist keeps repeating that I should start confronting super scary scenarios (e.g. eating super fast very big meal at work) instead of ""only"" scary scenarios (eating full meal at home mindfully). Today I was asked to choose either doing with her full-blown exposures, including possibility of panic attack, extreme anxiety and in nutshell my worst-case scenarios, or just stopping.

Issue is that currently I am working (fully dependent on my income, no family support) and finishing my master thesis. Because of that, I am very busy, stressed and anxious on daily basis and feel like I am completely unable to accommodate right now that amount of anxiety that would come with those exposures. I am really doubting whether it would help, and almost confident that given circumstances (a lot of work and pressure) it would almost surely mess up my life. 

What do you think I should do about it? I am also hesitating whether exposure therapy is a way to go at all. It does seem to be medically suited for my case (strong anxiety around particular activities/sensations), but I do not see much progress and feel only growing pressure from my psychologist that actually make me feel worse. 

Does any of you have experience with exposure therapy? What would you suggest? Should I still go on with it despite my thesis and work (won't I become complete wreck?)? Should I pick it up after graduating? Or maybe just try going to psycho-dynamic/psychoanalysis? I just feel my anxiety is strongly driven by my life stressors (work, studies, friends, girlfriend) and pressure that comes with.

Losing Weight,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I’m not sure if this is allowed, but I want to give a trigger warning because this post will be about eating habits and body weight.

I (F21) have always been (or felt like) a bigger person than everyone else. I am also tall, which doesn’t help with that sentiment. Right now, I am 5’8 and near 200lbs. This is the biggest I have ever been, and it makes me feel so horrible about myself.
When I was in high school, I was very underweight and I wasn’t eating nearly enough. I was roughly 125lbs in high school. 
I was a junior in high school when the c*vid stuff happened, and I was at home instead of out all the time. I started eating more normally and not starving myself, and I put on a good amount of weight. I got to around 160 lbs which was honestly so good for me because I didn’t feel horrible all the time like I used to. I would constantly be dizzy and just exhausted all the time, but when I started eating more I just felt good.

Over the last two years, I’ve struggled with binge eating and it’s been pretty out of control. About 6 months ago, I decided I was going to finally do something to try to combat the binge eating and get myself to a healthy weight and mindset. I started going to the gym and meal prepping as often as I could and really trying to make good choices about what I was eating. I didn’t really “diet”, but I just tried to make conscious choices about what I was eating and tried to keep in mind certain foods that I knew would send me into a binge session.

However, I had been doing this consistently for a few months, and I am still at the same weight that I have been at. I know it takes time, but I expected to see some kind of progress my now. It has been months and I am still exactly the same. 

The other day, I got so mad at myself for being fat which subconsciously sent me back into my ~starving~ mindset, like when I was in high school.

The last few days I haven’t eating anything except for some triscuits or vitamins. I have never been so obsessed about not eating before and it’s scaring me slightly that I like it so much.

I have lost 8lbs in like a week, which I know is probably just water weight but I feel like if I keep going then it will be fat too.

I just stress because some people that graduated the same year as me are about to graduate with their bachelors by the end of this year and I feel like if I had pushed myself more I would be in the same boat but I also remind myself that we all are in different journeys and we are not doing the same thing.

My friend got bullied, and that bully said something to me while showing me a butter knife they had.  
they threatened me with it, i wasn't scared but i was angry. I thought about taking the 'knife' and shoving it in her eyes. I didn't ofcourse, it would've gotten me in trouble. But i know if nobody would've known it was me, i would've done it.  


I get these urges sometimes randomly, and sometimes for a reason or two.   
To name an example, about a year and a half ago:  
I had a boyfriend, and i despised him. He was overly sexual, unfunny, unattractive, awkward, didn't know what no meant... i could go on. It was an online relationship aswell, so i couldn't have murdered him.. Wich made me wanna do it more. This is an example of reason.  
And example of no reason would be:  
I got angry for no real reason, atleast no obvious one.  
I first felt the urge to destroy something, then it got worse and worse;  
First i just wanted to kill a dog, i hate dogs. No, i despise dogs.  
They're loud, submissive, annoying, hard to care for.... (sorry not sorry)  
Then i wanted to kill a person. nobody in particular, wich is the biggest difference between reason and no reason. i just wanted to kill, torture... stab..  
It was getting bad to the point i couldn't stop shaking, or fidgeting.  
Don't get me wrong: i fidget and shake all the time, i've gotten used to it. but when this happens its more than usual.  
I've been dealing with these thoughts for a while, but not like theyre on my mind 24/7,  
but they just come back to me with such intensity every like 1-3 months, hold on for 10 minutes until i distract myself, and then go away. Not completely, and the physical effects take a while to return to normal aswell. And usually, it will come again in either the same day, or next day. It can come multiple times a day or two, then go for 1-3 months, and repeat.   


I found out the most common cause of this is relationships, rather it'd be friends or partner.  
As i said, i've dealt with this for a few years now, but it got worse around 2019 and continued getting worse and worse. i think the worst it got was 2022 until now, and i got 2 or 3 of these this year, so maybe 2023 will become the next worst year.  


What do i want from posting this? Multiple things.  
1. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my mind. i never really told anyone about this, due to fear of judgement.  
2. I wanna know whats going on with me, this doesn't feel normal.  
3. Support, i know if i wanna get better, i need support.  
4. Maybe similar stories to help myself understand why i feel this way, and that im not alone.  


What do i absolutely NOT want?  
Telling me i'm a horrible human being, i know that already. I did a lot of fucked up shit because of my mental health and im not excusing myself or distancing myself from all bad actions i've done, but just understand that im torturing myself with my own thoughts already.  


Now , i wanna end this with saying a few things. If there will be any questions - I'll answer them to the best of my ability. If anyone needs support and advice with similar things - I'll do my best to help.  
I  know others and myself included need a space where they can say every bad thing about themselfs,  
Otherwise nobody will become a better human being.

I'm not looking forward to dating her again since I know our romantic relationship isn't going to last. Her family situation is messed up and her health isn't great either. I never even found her physically attractive, so why does it bother me to see her with someone else?
I'm starting to worry that their friendship might turn into something more, which is really getting to me. I know it's not healthy to dwell on these thoughts.

I had anxiety since I was starting normal  high school at 14 because I was in special Ed class from grades 4 to 8 because of my low iq which as a kid was from 55 to 70 and as an adult it’s 85 to 88 since I was worried if I can graduate or not. Which o graduated normal high school in four years taking summer school twice.

I remember dropping three course one twice and taking summer class to pass all three graduating from college with 3.46 gpa. I was in two year college business program which I finished four years part time at 24. I’m 30 now. 

Anxiety affected me keeping a normal non sign holder and non mascot job because I worry if I was competent enough and in the right job. Longest I lasted in a normal non sign holder job was three months and shortest two days because of my anxiety and being over simulated like not having good listening skills in noisy environments. 

So I now got a sign holder job which I maintained for two years now but have two year five month experience from two temp sign holder jobs. I work as a mascot once a year in the summer since 2022 for a summer special event company.

The Unspoken Taboo That Self-Help Experts Never Warn You About,81,False,False,True,False,7,False,"I am going to briefly discuss the inner friction you may endure when making personal changes to yourself. I’m talking about the personal changes that involve the restructuring of your attitude and beliefs. If you are attempting to make significant changes to your beliefs for the first time in your life then you will experience extreme turbulence. This is because, at the beginning of your journey, you may be dealing with a lot of issues from your past that you have repressed without resolving. Although you put these issues behind you, they are still influential in your present reality. Therefore, expect significant resistance from your subconscious mind during your very first “go-around.” As you progress in life and continue to make changes, you will be dealing with less turbulence because you will have already resolved the major issues during your first attempts to change your mental circuitry. 

Unresolved issues are like open applications on your computer. If you don't completely shut down a program, it will continuously run in the background and compromise the performance of the computer. You won’t notice the computer slowing down at first, but as time progresses and more programs are left open, the compromised performance will become more apparent. If you attempt to open a new program when too many programs are running in the background, the chief operating system will alert you to close some of the open programs in order to provide the required processing power.

Much like operating a P.C., the first time you attempt to make changes, you may notice a lot of old issues resurfacing to request your attention. These issues need to be dealt with or “closed” so you can proceed with the new “program” you wish to run. Surfaced issues are your mind’s way of alerting you that the changes you want to make conflicts with old beliefs that are still running in the background. Your mind will surface any old beliefs that contradict your new installed-beliefs because it needs you to pick one and close the other.

Another reason why you will be dealing with inner conflict is because the mind hates change. Making changes in your routine is a threat to the survival mechanism in your primitive brain called the amygdala. It figures it has survived this long, doing what it was doing, and any change is a possible threat to its life. You may feel this conflict on a lower animalistic level, which is why it will not make sense to you logically.

Keep in mind that the negative experiences I list should only last a few weeks. During that time you may want to lay low and take it easy. These are some of the occurrences you should expect: 

You may experience guilt, which is the conflict between the heart and mind. You might find yourself having consistent feelings like you did something wrong, but you can't pinpoint what it is. It might even escalate to you worrying that you're going to be punished for doing something wrong, but you still can't pinpoint what you did wrong, let alone why you're going to be punished and who is going to punish you. If this is your situation then the less you do, the less you'll have to second-guess yourself. Lay low until the negative feelings reside.

Very similar to guilt and a possible result of guilt is anxiety. Just like guilt, this may be a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to you. In general, it's a feeling of fear and worry. This can come as a sharp pain in the chest, followed by a rapid heartbeat and loss of breath that will wake you from your sleep. You may find yourself not wanting to do anything, but instead, wanting to stay home or anywhere you feel safe. Anxiety can surface in different ways at different times. The primary symptom of anxiety is an intense worry. Again, lay low until it resides. Also, be aware of what may be triggering your anxiety as it will be a clue on the issues you need to address.

You may experience nightmares, or dreams that are disturbing to you. On a similar note, you may find yourself being bombarded with thoughts and emotions that you aren't usually bombarded with. Mostly, these are issues that are surfacing because they need to be dealt with before you can behold the new beliefs you are trying to behold. 

You might suddenly remember a situation when someone wronged you which makes you feel anger or rage. As these types of memories and emotions surface, you need to reevaluate the situation then forgive yourself for letting it happen. You need to realize you are older and wiser now and didn't know any better at the time. The best way to deal with these kinds of thoughts is to identify how you allowed the situation to be, then work on those areas so you never allow a situation like that into your experiences again. If you don’t take this approach, it will be an ongoing internal loop of anger that can't be resolved because closure is impossible in this type of situation. The only thing you can do about a situation like this is to make sure you do what you have to do, from now on, to ensure it won't happen again. You can only have power over your actions and reactions, so only stay where you have the ability to be proactive.

Confusion is common whenever undergoing changes in your life because your mind is rewiring itself while also trying to function like normal. Going back to the computer analogy, you are simultaneously starting new programs that contradict the old ones, and we aren't as easily programmable as a personal computer. We can’t just delete unwanted programs, but instead, have to override unwanted programs with new ones. That said, during this process, you will have too many programs running at once which will cause slow speeds and lag in your mind. This, in turn, will cause you to experience mental exhaustion which creates physical exhaustion. You may not have the energy you usually have, or would like to have. However, keep in mind that this will only last a couple of weeks, so hang in there.

You may find yourself in a state of deep depression. This depression can derive from your realizing you are going to have to leave cherished comforts behind. Sometimes, the changes you attempt will separate you from friends and loved ones. Sometimes moving on means to move away from the old ways as they no longer can support your new experiences. This can be your moving away from a location, or your moving away from others. 

This brings me to the obvious of needing more sleep because this is when the brain can recuperate, and it will require much recuperation during this process. When you are awake, you may feel a bit overwhelmed which will create confusion and a lack of motivation to do anything. You will want nothing more than to be blissfully zoned out because that will be the most comfortable way to be while the rewiring process takes place.

Remember that everything I listed should only last a few weeks. Eventually, your mind will give in and reorganize old beliefs to suit your new intentions and goals. This is, of course, after it rebelliously kicks and screams for a little bit because it doesn't like to change, hence the reason for the bad thoughts and nightmares. Any new way of living and thinking is a bit traumatic for the brain.

I've told friends how awful I feel but they always play it off as a joke due to the nonchalant attitude I have towards my issues.

My friend and I were both crying all lesson one time, two hours straight. My teacher was constantly checking on them, but even as j was right beside them crying, I was completely ignored. I've told that teacher about my insecurities and issues before, but they didn't really take notice, maybe because I wasn't crying?

Another friend and I went to see the school counsellor together due to our similar issues. He focused on her the entire time. She was crying, I wasn't. 

I don't know what it is, but no matter how hard I call for help, from flaunting my issues to straight asking, no one takes me seriously.

Overwhelmed + Discouraged,1,True,False,True,False,2,False,"My husband and I just moved to a small city for his career (Police Officer). It's his dream job in our ideal home, unfortunately I haven't been able to shake this sense of shame I have about my future and my job. For context, I'm a 31yo female, with a Bachelor's in Graphic Design. I have done **everything** under the sun: bartender/barista, studio manager/producer, adjunct instructor at a state university, product design and development assistant for Kroger/TJX/Home Depot/Wayfair, freelance graphic designer, taught English overseas, a Champions site director, a Rover dog-walker, and now... a retail worker who teaches Hiit classes part time.

I feel so much shame, anger, and depression towards my future and the ""loss of potential,"" I feel like I've become. I once was so motivated to seize opportunities and apply my creative tenacity to any position I held - I even made time for extensive volunteer work, but from 2020 until 2022 I've been unemployed twice and it brought everything to a halt. I was affected by Covid and company reorganization as well as poor financial decisions by a start-up.  It really extinguished my hopes and I haven't been able to shake that anxiety of finding a steady job since - let alone GET a decent job.

I was always one who self-initiated projects, took great ownership of my responsibilities, strived for leadership opportunities, and truly did my best to support the team as a whole. I've been told I'm incredibly gifted as a saleswoman and communicator, as well as someone who can be thrown any role and succeed in it. I even got REAL close to a a fantastic job I thought would be a solid combination of my varied experiences, but then the hiring manager told me they hired her friend and changed the role to ""better suit her experience,"" but she ""truly recognized my value and the strengths I'd bring to any company."" I believed her, but... woof.

So now I feel STUCK and I am really scared that I won't have anything to retire with, I'll always have to struggle between two jobs, and fully rely on my husband's income for our larger bills.

It's only become more difficult to believe in myself and look at job boards without having a full panic attack. I'm working 35hrs as a retail worker in a town where I feel like I'm constantly seen as an uneducated, incapable loser, and waste of space.

I realize my own perception of how employment = value is harboring my experience, but I feel **hopeless**. And now I've found myself - almost weekly, curling up into a ball, crying my eyes out because, ""What's the point of working so hard, learning anything new, being educated, being told, 'You're SO smart/You're such a GREAT problem solver/You're SO gifted!' just to feel like you're a waste of experiences and brain space.

I have turned 30 and I have no idea who I am. I have left my old identity in my twenties and I have no new one.,86,True,False,True,False,11,False,"I realized recently that I don't have a real plan for my 30+ years. I knew how to be a student. I was bright, knowledgeable and curious. My friends saw as much and expected me to not stop until I get a PhD.

Sadly, I haven't been able to exploit that potential because I have mood and personality disorder problems. I grew up alone and neglected and consequently developed Quiet BPD. By the time I reached 20 it became apparent even to my parents that something was wrong. I also suspect I have ADD. I couldn't choose a major, not for a lack of interest but because I was so anxious about life choices. I became depressed and sometimes a nerve wreck. Since then I went to several unis but didn't finish them, except for one that I was not interested in but was anxious that I'd become totally lost if I didn't complete it. And that was basically the last time I saw something through. Everything else since then has been temporary, including friends. I never lived with people. Not sure I am capable of. I have become grumpy and moody. I realized that no matter who I am with, I always need time alone because that's how my brain seems to work. Probably part of my BPD.

So, I'm essentially at the same place I was 10 years ago. If I look back to my life, it's a disaster. I was so anxious all the time that I basically missed out on life. I behaved very strangely and was as rigid as a teen as an old man. 

I live with my parents now and it's toxic, but at least they leave me alone most of the time and I'm not lonely. I yearn friends, communities, intimacy, people I can fully trust, the whole 'coming of age' experience that I never had, but it's too late. I know it is. Because no matter what I do 30 won't become 20. People my age have either committed or have steady career paths, but have had these experiences at any rate. I don't even want to think about it because it's so painful. I numb myself with spending lots of time sleeping. What's the scariest is that I can see myself change and how it becomes harder and harder to alter my attitude, my thoughts and my feelings. I used to be a mostly sad, but curious, hopeful and amicable guy. I knew something was wrong, but I always thought it'd pass over time. Now I'm beginning to think that I have deluded myself all this time - thinking particularly about my ADD. I am not sure I am even capable of pursuing studies anymore - and that this is who I have become, period. I don't wanna live like this, neither hit my forties.

How to deal with feeling restless and bored with life?,6,False,False,True,False,4,False,"I (23F) have been feeling restless and bored with life and that I’m not operating to my full potential. 

Some context: I did a lot of travel in 2021 and 2022 (living off of savings) and it was the happiest time of my life and the best memories. I felt so happy and free and I was meeting new people and online friends from all around the country. I felt so alive and thrived being in new environments and seeing and experiencing new things. 

2023 I did some travel (which I was able to do because I started working an independent contracting job) but mostly was in my hometown. I absolutely loved the work and freedom and flexibility with the independent contracting job, but the pay wasn’t always stable and I realized it was stressing me out with expenses and also getting pressure from family.

So, I got a second job about a 2 months ago. It’s part time cleaning in an assisted living center. I already feel bored and restless. (I have had several jobs over the years and tend to job hop)

I feel like I just go to this minimum wage job I don’t even care about, for what? Just to cover my expenses. How is this leading me farther to where I want to be? How can I get more freedom back into my life again?

I fantasize about leaving and have been looking into other jobs, but I feel so unsure lately. I feel like 

I also currently live with my family who are toxic and it takes a huge toll on my mental health and how I feel. I have a lot of resentment towards my parents, and I also suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD (sent a message out to a therapist and waiting for a reply). 

When I am home I spend the majority of time in my room. I come down to make myself food but a lot of times I even put that off because I don’t want to be around my family. 

Moving out would be ideal but to do that I would need to stay at a job long enough obviously to pay for everything and I don’t see myself long term at any of these employee jobs I’ve had so far. 😅

What do I do? How do I get back to the lifestyle I was living while also creating some sort of stability for myself at the same time? Has anyone else experienced this?",False,False,selfhelp,172413,New,2024,2,Very high,0,54,2124,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0

Help me understand: Effort vs. Outcome under trauma lens,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I am in therapy  for depression, ADHD and CPTSD.

Throughout my life, I've held the belief that if you work hard, you will be rewarded with generally positive outcomes (e.g. work hard in school —> get decent grades; work out and eat well —> become more fit). This was scripted by my emotionally matured parents who failed in their career but expected perfection form me.

I am trying to unlearn their metrics for defining my worth. Until now fear of failure kept me a A  student but now, I am on a gap year preparing for a highly competitive entrance exam for medical college admissions and struggling to focus on studying. This exam is an essential requirement to seek admission in a good public medical college with affordable fees and demands a rank of at least the top 1000.

I’m reckoning with the fact that while you can control your effort, you cannot ensure your desired external outcomes. Additionally, the “cycle of rewards” is far slower . It takes months to prep for exam and years to make significant advancements in my medical career. How do you balance the fact that you can’t control outcomes without becoming hopeless about the future (i.e. still putting in effort even when you can't guarantee results and/or those results are very delayed)?.

After multiple sibling suicide attempts,18,False,False,True,False,3,False,"When ever you read any article about suicide attempts and how they affects families it's all about caring for the person who has attempted suicide. Of course this is extremely important and is the main focus after an attempt. However, after having a sibling (18) attempt suicide multiple times (3)(before, after and during each attempt this sibling has been in therapy and in multiple in and out patient programs) these attempts really take a tole on me(20), my other sibling (22) and my parents. I can see my mom feels like a failure, so does my dad. This all ends up weighing heavily on my other sibling and I. I have reached out to mental health professionals and none of them have helped me with the amount this weighs on me they all just tell me to be there for this sibling. It makes me what feels like irrationally angry this sibling keeps attempting, I know its no their fault, but it just puts so much pressure on my family. I have no idea if this is normal even after talking to mental health professionals. Sometimes I can't get over how selfish it feels like it is even though I know their not trying to be selfish. It's genuinely just takes up so much of my mental capacity I can barely do everything I need to do to support myself, succeed in school and work as well as support my parents and my sibling. It's just feels like a heavy burden. I have no idea how else to describe it. It's just all too much for my mental capacity. Has anyone else in this situation experienced anger like this or this overwhelming feeling of this just being too much. I obviously want to be there for this sibling but I'm already barely holding myself together and I just get this weird anger towards this sibling as well as being over whelmed.

"Why do girls do this, if you like a guy, fucking say it stop dragging us along and playing with our emotions.",8,True,False,True,False,8,False,"  This girl recently took a liking to me and started texting me over whatsapp. Up until now i dont know if she likes me or if she is just stringing me along for her own self esteme. I have been nothing but nice to this girl, asking her how her day was, sending her morning text messages of encouragement, listening to her petty problems but i just cant seem to let go of her. Some part of me believes that her and her roommate are just toying with my emotions and another part thinks that she might like me ( i cant emphasize might enough ). I never asked her why she started talking to me because i figured it might scare her off cause i would come off as being unfriendly but now i feel horrible because i let her into my life and she can probably get with another guy and forget all about me. I barely have any friends and talking to her kinda helped me feel a little better about myself but now i feel like i will never live up to her expectation of what she might want in a guy.

"Idk what to do, I’m so confused, my anxiety is driving me insane.",2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"

I’m (f18) from India and last year I went for my undergraduate degree to the US, My mental health got ruined there, I was depressed and anxious and had suicidal thoughts. I came back to my city in India. I’ve decided to continue my education here. But there aren’t great colleges in my city. However I’m deciding between 2 colleges, one in my city where I’ll be able to live in my house itself, but the college isn’t that great. And my other choice is a college in a different city, however it is a much better college with more like minded people. Initially the main reason I was considering the college in the other city was because I thought the overall experience would be better. But the more I think I about it, I ask my self am I just considering that college because of the social life or the academics. Cause my mental health is absolutely dog shit. I’m crying every day with no purpose whatsoever. If I’m atleast in my city, I have my family as my support system and I can try out some other hobbies and business opportunities on the side. I just don’t know what to do. Cause I’m also seeing all my friends who went abroad to study and they’re all enjoying college and I’m here not able too, so I feel the extra pressure to experience that “college life”.",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55680,Hot,2024,1,Medium,0,65,1267,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0
I don’t trust my partner anymore,1,False,False,True,False,6,False,"I can’t bring myself to trust my partner anymore

Recently me and my partner (together for 8 months, both 20yo) were walking down one of the busiest cities of our city (it was around 2 pm) when a drunk man came up to us. He said to my partner that they have a “beautiful woman” and proceeded to ask me if this is “my n-word”. I didn’t what was going on, I laughed nervously. He started saying something that I couldn’t understand and I honestly don’t know why I didn’t just walk away. 
Than he asked me to kiss kis cheeks and I was so terrified/dumb that I did that. He said he bets my partner is jealous now. Than he asked me to kiss his penis, and I started saying “no no no” and asking me to go for a beer together, do I like “my partners penis” and asking my partner if he is allowed to kiss my genitals. That’s when I unfroze and walked away saing “no no no”. He didn’t follow us. 

My partner stood there the whole time, next to me, holding my hand and didnt try to do anything. They didn’t say anything or try to pull me away. 

When we walked away I had this feeling that I won’t ever be proteced by them and I realised that I needed that.

We talked about this situation a lot and they said they feel enormous guilt, that they felt they should do something but they froze. They apologised a lot and I trust them that they mean it. I feel like they’re telling me the truth. I can tell they cannot forgive themselves that.

But this situation changed our dynamic, I feel weird around them, whenever they promise they will do something I question it, I don’t really trust things they say to me. I have a tendency to not initiate intimacy I feel like I have been lied to about all the feelings. 
I don’t know what to do. I can’t remember being this sad.

Feminism makes me want to die,0,False,False,True,False,3,True,"Reading about feminism or speaking with pro-feminist people makes me want to die. It's not an exaggeration and not a joke. I'm not trolling you.

Sometimes feminists [say directly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html) that I should hate myself. But even without explicit misandry, the feminist theory is full of things that make me feel very bad about myself and sometimes even doubt my own sanity. Sometimes I feel like it pushes me to the conclusion I shouldn't deal with women at all because I'm dangerous to them. Every step I take is a potential danger to women.

I have a long history of mental health issues and sometimes I feel that dealing with feminism is too much for me. Feeling like I'm constantly accused, directly and indirectly, and then being gaslighted (*""no, feminism doesn't accuse you, it only fights for equality""*) is too much for me.

One of the things I hate most about feminist theory is the concept of objectification. This concept is very fuzzy, unclear, indistinct. The line between accepted nudity and objectification is blurred up to the point of non-existence, which I often perceive as shaming me for my sexuality. I've spent days, weeks, and months trying to understand this concept and I do understand some of its manifestations, but often it is interpreted in a way I perceive as shaming me for the fact that I am sexually attracted to female bodies.

A few days ago I made a post about this in a mental health sub, and some people suggested I was a troll. Some of them behaved in a way that suggested I didn't understand something obvious. It makes me either feel stupid or doubt whether I'm sane.

What helps me to some extent to feel better is deliberately refraining from reading anything about feminism or talking with pro-feminist people. But sometimes it's difficult because pro-feminist people are everywhere. Seeing things like a post by a mental health resource mentioning ""toxic masculinity"" may start these doubts again. Yes, it often takes place in the form of doubts: should I hate myself? Should I feel ashamed for liking female bodies in advertisements? Maybe I don't understand something? Maybe I'm stupid? Is feminism right? Or are MRA right?

What also helps me (though it's to some extent the opposite of the previous) is reading and participating in MRA groups. But it makes me feel very, very uncomfortable to see how the men's rights movement is unfairly radicalized in society. One person in a mental health sub saw my profile and said they think I'm *""being radicalized in real time""*. When I hear something like that, I start doubting my own sanity. Because I don't understand why the MRM subs where I participate are radical. I see much more radical things in feminist groups.

Seeing [people who feel the way I do](https://archive.ph/0H2gL) also helps me. I feel not alone.

MRA subs is one of the things that helped me not to have suicidal thoughts from dealing with feminism for a few months. But today it happened again when I saw this:

*""The over-sexualization of the female breast is a danger to us. The censorship of the “female” nipple is a danger to us.""*

Such things honestly make me feel like I want to die. Something is wrong with the fact I find female breasts sexually attractive. It's not natural, it's been imposed by society. And it's harmful to women. I should stop being attracted to them. Or stop dealing with women. Or die.

Being shamed for such basic things as your sexual attraction is very, very painful.

Do I remember anything similar from my childhood? Probably yes, but it was much smaller. In my teen years, I constantly received messages like *""all men want is to have sex""* and ""*women are not interested in sex as much as men""*, which made a contribution to my fear of girls. Such messages made me feel dirty and guilty about my sexual desires. I always felt like I shouldn't show girls my sexual interest, because it could repulse them. Also, there was another kind of shaming — kind and tender feelings toward girls (and people in general) were disapproved by other boys.

Feminism contributes to my shame of sexual desires and reinforces it. It promotes the same message I received in childhood: women don't like it when men see them as sexually attractive.

Now I want to say a few things to avoid common accusations:

1. No, I'm not far-right. I'm not even conservative. My political views are liberal.
2. No, I don't hate women. I LOVE THEM. Seems like feminism is telling me there is something wrong with my attraction to them.
3. No, I'm not afraid to ""lose my male privilege"", because I don't feel privileged. I'm an unmarried and currently unemployed man with a chronic mental disorder.
4. No, I don't have anything against women in high management positions. I wouldn't mind if my government was 50% female or even 100% female.
5. No, don't feel ""entitled to sex"". But I do feel sexually frustrated, which is very, very painful.
6. No, this post is not a manifestation of my ""toxic masculinity"". I think I'm closer to the opposite pole — I'm rather androgynous, shy, and extremely unconfident in real-life social situations.

I'm planning to post this in a few subs — suicide support, MRA, and probably somewhere else. If you are not going to say anything constructive or supportive, please don't say anything. I have had enough comments that were the opposite of constructiveness or supportiveness, so I don't have to worry about keeping balance to be objective. Please don't say anything like *""don't act in a degrading manner towards women""*, because I never do such things and I'm not inclined to such behaviour. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about sexualized images of women and my desire in general, which I feel is being shamed.

How seriously suicidal am I? Not to the point of planning to kill myself today, but enough to the point that if one day I kill myself, one of the reasons may be the things I described above. I hope the moderators of MRM subs where I'm planning to post this won't find my post inappropriate. It's not suicidal ideation or incitement to suicide. And though I'm in crisis, this crisis is rather chronic than sharp.

I have been made to feel like a bad partner and father and now I want to end my life.,1,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I've been made to feel like a poor fiancé and father and now I feel like ending my life tonight.

I won't explain to much, however to put it bluntly an issue happened, we almost lost our unborn child due to it, however my baby and fiancée are okay. This is due to the actions of their delivery driver.

As a result I made a complaint to the company, and asked a legal advice subreddit for aid (post now deleted) in regards to potential damages as my complaint was fobbed off and called an ""inconvenience"". I didn't want compensation before this, only action, however their actions made me consider legal action.

Despite this multiple people called me sickening, stating all I cared about was money, and that I did not care for my fiancée or child. I argued I could have chased this man, and didn't to care for their and took them to emergency for treatment and stayed all night, but that wasn't good enough.

Am I really a bad partner for seeking damages for my partner? For being insulted by a half assed apology and no guarantee the driver will be dealt with?

The whole thing has really messed with my MH, I now am awake at midnight while she sleeps considering hanging myself in the next field over so that they can have a life free of me. Free of my selfishness and disgusting behaviour.

I know these people are probably right, seriously I doubt so many can be wrong, and I imagine people here will confirm that too. However I don't know what to do about these suicidal thoughts. They worry me.

Struggling With OCD and My Story,1,False,False,True,False,5,False,"So there's This Girl let's call her Mukti(19F). So I(19M) knew her from 6th grade. We used to hate each other and fought alot. It was over grades mostly. I used to be an self absorbed A-hole too. 

&#x200B;

I met her again in 11th grade. I changed quite alot after 6th grade. We started talking. She was weak in English and I helped her. And I fell in love with her. After 2-3 months I proposed and she said No. She told me she can't get in relationship because of family and there wasn't any other reason. My cousin asked her why she rejected me and she told her she liked me but she can't get into a relationship because of strict family and casteism She rejected everyone and never been In a relationship. I was fine with it and we remained friends. But I missed school for one day. The next day she started crying and told me how my ""Friend"" made a joke about us. She was crying and saying that it will ruin her reputation. I told my ""Friend"" to apologise and he did. But I learnt that she was fine with joke last day but her friend let's call her ""Meera"". She provoked mukti.

&#x200B;

 I didn't do anything but she still was angry and didn't talk to me. I was in a pretty bad mental state at that time. My friends some of who were rejected by her also provoked me. I was so stupid that I listened to them and pointed out mistakes in her question and lowered her marks in half yearly exam. She got pretty emotional and said ""I trusted you and you would do this?"".

I felt so guilty. My friends provoked me for weeks but I was the one being stupid. I apologized and Tried to make things right. It got better. I suffered from some illness during yearly exam and almost died (Not exaggerating). But I met her again during exams. She asked me how I was.

After that we met when we came to check the result. We talked for some time. I was first In school and she was second. I congratulated her and she congratulated me.

And than comes...the 12th grade.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On first day she completely ignored me and talked with everyone except me. I asked her what happened but she would just laugh. She would always complain about my homework to teacher.

My only true friend tried to make things right. He talked to her about it and she started talking to me. We talked for 2 hours and everything was great. But next day she suddenly stopped. She told me please leave me alone. Also her friend meera was absent last day. Whenever she was with Mukti, mukti's behaviour changed. Meera never liked me, and her reason was because of I used to be in 6th grade. I mean we were just kids and she just met me in 11th grade. Whenever she and mukti fought she would say bad things about mukti behind her back.

One day I asked her what happened, she told me we were never friends or anything.

On her birthday I tried to give her a chocolate as a gift. Meera refused. I told her I want to give mukti the gift.

Mukti asked me why I care so much about her?

I didn't answer, she said leave me alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Last day I was absent in school. My friend was trying to make things right again. Mukti told him she just doesn't want to talk with me.

She asked my friend about some other girl I was talking to. My friend told her that she was just a friend. Mukti told him I don't want to talk to him if He is interested in some other girl. Me and mukti still don't talk with each other.

My cousin who studies in same class as me told me about meera and how she always provokes mukti.

Also I learnt that Arjun( My Friend who provoked me against mukti) was talking behind my back.

&#x200B;

Finally I fixed my Relationship with Her. She didn't forced me to become her brother my tying rakhi on my hand. Started talking like normal. 

&#x200B;

So today I showed her the chats and how arjun tried to influence me. She believed me. 

My cousin Bhavna asked her if you would marry Abhishek if he becomes an IAS?

She said she would not marry me even if I became ias.

I was pretty said and I was crying. My friend was with me. She didn't knew because she was dancing. My bestfriend yogita knew and asked me why are you crying? I am worried. She was sitting near Muktika.

I was talking with my friend. She called me and said ""There's one percent chance that she would agree."" Yogita said If she doesn't like anybody else and falls in love till you became an ias, she would agree.

I said let's talk clearly. I said I my love isn't like that. She( muktika) said I know. I said if I became ias would you agree. She said if you became an ias and convinced my parents than I am ready. I said what about you? She said it's her parents choice. She said you have 7 years. I said will you wait?

She said Yes I will.

&#x200B;

but today she declined and said I just said that so you wouldn't hurt yourself and I am sorry. She got sad too and went home and was depressed. 

&#x200B;

Next week I tried to talk to her and she said I can't talk to you. 

The teachers asked me what is happening and why I look depressed. 

&#x200B;

Muktika came and explained the whole thing. The teacher even said Abhishek doesn't have wrong feelings for you ( physical relationship). Muktika said I have feelings too but I can't ma'am. I don't want to ruin my family's name( caste problem).

&#x200B;

We stopped talking after it

&#x200B;

I can't forget her and I can't fall in love with Anyone else. I still want to try and I am obsessed with her I don't like when any other guy talks to her even after knowing that she won't be anyone else's. I want her and i dream about her. I try but I can't forget her. I am afraid to move on.

5 things you can do when you lose all motivation to do your work.,95,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello everyone! Simran here. Today I want to talk about those days where you feel unfocused, confused and unmotivated to do the work you need to do, and what to do in order to get out of that mental state. So if you have lately been feeling like you lack the clarity and direction needed to effectively do your work without dealing with extreme procrastination and resistance, you need to pay attention to this post because I will explain to you 5 things you can do in order to clear that mental fog that keeps you from moving forward with your work.

It seems like some days you are on top of the world, creativity just flows through you and doing the things you should do, your work, becomes really easy. You feel inspired, motivated, happy and no obstacle is big enough for you. It feels like a new you has been born, a new you that has a solution for every big problem the old you felt tormented by. Life is good, and you just can’t wait to kick ass from now on… Except you wake up a few days later and that feeling is gone. You don’t feel inspired, you don’t feel indestructible and you certainly don’t feel motivated to do your work. Well, what happened? Everything seemed fine and your next actions felt crystal clear, why are you suddenly feeling lost and having second thoughts? Where did all of that creativity and inspiration went? Why does your goals and dreams seem impossible to achieve now?

We all know how hard it is to do your work when you just don’t feel inspired or motivated. It feels like trying really hard to do something that “should” come out naturally. I mean, how good can your work actually be when it’s completely forced, right? The reality is that some days you just won’t feel capable and motivated, it’s part of being a human, you can’t really avoid it. What you CAN do instead is find ways to quickly and effectively get out of that mental state so that you can go back to kicking ass as soon as possible. Here are 5 ways you can do that:

1. **Meditation.** The purpose of meditation is to bring more consciousness and awareness to your life. Meditation allows you to have a more centered approach to life so that you are not thrown off by it’s challenges. People are often controlled by their emotions and thoughts, they live life in reaction to whatever their environment throws at them. This eventually leads to problems like anxiety, depression, mental barriers and overall negative experiences. When you meditate, you start bringing more clarity to your mind, it becomes way easier to start taking action and start taking your mind in the direction you consciously choose.
2. **Exercise.** I don’t think I can tell you any new benefit that comes from exercising that you don’t already know so let this serve as a reminder on why you need to constantly be moving your body. Put simply: You move your body, you release feel-good chemicals like endorphins, you boost your mood. When you are constantly in a good mood, you are also constantly feeling inspired and motivated. I know that most of you are tired of hearing the same “solution” thing over and over again, and you may be looking for the best “hacks” or “techniques” to completely stop procrastination, but if you are not doing the most basic things like exercising, why are you even looking for more “advanced” techniques or hacks? Get the basics right first.
3. **Getting out of your routine.** We all have routines, they are necessary up to some point. The problem is that when you are following your routine, your mind stays ""stuck"" in routine mode, you think about the same things and you act the same way. If you want to make a change, you need to quite literally change your environments and actions. Get out of your frequent environments (your house, work, office, etc) and visit some new ones. I realize not everyone of us has the ability to travel at will, but chances are, you can at least take 1 or 2 days to go to a new place. A new cafe, a new park, a new museum, a new city, etc. This will force your mind to approach things differently. You open your mind to a new flow of thoughts, it's more likely you'll get new ideas and solutions for your problems. If you do this, try to fully experience it, don't distract yourself with the same things you always do (generally speaking, social media, the internet, music, podcasts, etc). Yes, if you are reading this video around the time it came out, going out is probably not the best idea at the moment, but once things cool down, give it a try and let me know how it works for you.
4. **Write down anything that has your attention.** With thousands of different thoughts going on in your mind every single second, it becomes really hard to organize and understand the issues that are causing these negative feelings, your problems are not exactly clear and they seem bigger and scarier than they really are. When you start writing down and planning your actions on paper, you make sure you won’t lose those steps you wrote down in a sea of useless, random thoughts. Your mind does a lot of work for you, help it by lifting that weight off it’s back and start thinking on paper.
5. **Getting external help.** Let’s be honest, we are masters at putting up excuses and rationalizing our lack of action. No matter how “convincing” an excuse is, at the end of the day it is still an excuse, and you’ll still carry that knowledge deep down inside of you. Guess what that transforms into? Feeling lost, anxious, depressed, worthless, stuck, etc. Find external people that won’t put up with your BS excuses, people that offer different perspectives and ideas you can implement in your life, people that inspire and motivate you to take action on your goals and not stay stuck inside your head. A community just like this one is great, make sure you take advantage of it. Post your questions, ask for advice, share the things you’ve learned, etc. I’m trying my best to become someone like that for you all, and all my content is made with that in mind, but it doesn’t has to be necessarily me, there are thousands of great people out there, and finding them is now really easy with the Internet. You don’t have to do this alone, please understand that.

With these 5 tips you now have what you need to get out of a blocked mental state, there are no excuses. It’s not going to be easy but it is going to be necessary if you want to become your authentic self. There’s no need to sit around hoping you’ll randomly find the motivation you need to achieve your goals, you are more than capable to create inspiration yourself, and only when you realize this you’ll understand how strong you can be. You are in a battle against resistance/procrastination, and you have to be ruthless. Remember, you are a warrior and nothing less.... You've got this.

I started my new job this week and I already miss my previous workplace.

I don’t miss the job, but I miss the people that I worked with. I worked there for almost 2 years and I made some friends.
I have social anxiety and depression, it’s really hard for me to adjust in a new environment. I guess I was just so comfortable at my old workplace and around my colleagues.
The job was awful to the point where I had to leave for the sake of my mental health.

But I’ve just been missing my old workplace, and I’ve even cried a few times. I know it sounds pathetic but I find it hard to adjust in a new place.
I keep thinking about my previous workplace and how I got along with everyone.
I’m still friends with one of my old colleagues.

My new colleagues are very nice and friendly.
I’ve only been working there for 3 days, but I hope I get over this depression or whatever it is soon.

edit:  

i don't think so. that's what i'm debating about. you are talking of all narcissists like they are as bad as sex offenders and they are not. many sex offenders are not narcissists and many narcissists are not sex offenders. both lack empathy. but i don't know why are narcissists put down so much.. at least even if they consider themselves special they don't lack physical or emotional empathy to the point they cant say if someone is in gross pain or no  
 edit:  

i like a comment on this : Because of stigma. Many people arm chair diagnosis the people who have abused them with NPD. Doesn't help that self-help books and trauma/recovery literature constantly emphasize NPD and other cluster B conditions.  
It sucks, and many people are just downright cruel, and they don't have a condition. Meaning, it's just what they choose to do, and nothing is causing it.

porn ruined my life and my family is abusive,0,True,False,True,False,4,True,"I'm 14,and when I was 7,my uncle gave me porn.It didn't took long until I started searching for grotesque porn.Such as cp,necrophilia,etc.And I followed a necrophilic incestuous pedophilic masochistic cult.When I was in 6th grade,I was ""playing"" with my classmates a ""game"" (basically,I was assaulting as many girls as possible)I was predenting I was fucking the air,and I was forced to eat trash in school.
I believed that women were incestuous zoophilic pedophiles,whilst I was casually searching for bestiality porn,creamed myself to no peace with scenarios of leftists and women being predatory rapists to kids,other women and animals.I was a racist fuck.

And well,my family's shit.My mom and sis usually have drama over the silliest subject,my dad abuses his mom,and my mom's mom is slowly dying,whilst my entire family uses her as a slave.With a large hernia preventing her to life the time of her life.

I've been very quiet and I'm not confident to tell my problems to my parents.And well,because if they learn,my sis with my dad would destroy my phone,and my sis would make her ""pranks"" upon me.

Porn introduced me to intrusive thoughts of sorts.Like pedophilic scenarios,incestual thoughts,etc.It also made me feel uncomfortable with people of the opposite sex,and of kids.It also made me closeted in myself,and well,I was a bigoted incel who wanted to fuck anything female,regardless if it is related to kin,or if they're different species entirely.

Now I'm 14,and I realized I'm a predatory bigot in disguise,waiting to happen,and I stopped watching porn and masturbating,now I fight my intrusive thoughts and prejudice that porn and the internet have plugged to me.I hate the fact that I sexulize everything that resembles sex and people who are feminine,or have big titties and ass.Or and a bulge in their scrotum.

What should I do if I think my co workers hates me but I wanna be friends with them?,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking or these thoughts are true.

Feel like I'm going crazy,1,True,False,True,False,0,False,"So much shit has happened these last 8 years it's fucking me up

~ 8 years ago (2016)
Was living with parents, across the state, hanging out with friends daily and going to community College

Met girl through a friends girlfriend
Got into relationship with said girl
Move across state with said girl
Dated her for almost 4 years, saw my whole life with her, thought I would marry her

She dumps me in 2020 and immediately starts fucking around with new dudes, woke up one night to her on tinder while in bed with me (before she officially dumped me)

Parents move her out while I'm at work one day, come back to almost all her shit packed.

She leaves, I can't sleep at night or be alone basically without feeling like I'm going crazy

It hurt so fucking bad I never want to experience that again

I had to video chat friends 24/7 when I was home and drink a LOT of vodka to feel normal

After a few months met a new girl
Liked her a lot
Started seeing her a lot
Became boyfriend and girlfriend with girl
Fell in love with new girl
Started a life with new girl

4 years later, the breakup I went through before new girl is starting to hurt again. A LOT. All the fucking time. It's driving me crazy. I still see her face on the walls, I see my memories play out, places we sat in the house, conversations we had, etc

It's literally driving me crazy and I don't know what to do

I don't know if it's just that, or if it's cause I miss family, or what's going on. It's been 7 (almost 8) years since I moved here and I miss the fuck out of my family and friends

I miss life before I moved

I love new girl and I can see my life with her too but for some reason my heart is pulling me back so strongly and it's so hard to let myself fully move on when I just want to go back

I don't know what to do

I've been listening to the music I was listening to around the time of the breakup and that doesn't help I know but it's just so hard to process the last four years that have gone by and it's hard to process even the four that went by before then

I just want this to stop because it's literally driving me nuts and effecting my life and I'm stuck at the mercy of my memories that haunt me

I pretty much don't see any friends any more. Not that I even want to. It feels like all the friends I have here besides a few are fake as shit anyways. They stopped hitting me up a while ago, and I was always the one messaging first. The few good friends I have here are busy most of the time but we do get together when we can.

My lowest point was several years ago, when the combination of incredible loneliness, low self worth and work burnout with no good end in sight made me seriously consider suicide.

So far I tried:
- Zoloft, which sorta helped with the social anxiety and mood, but had awful gastro intestinal (and sexual) side effects
- Lexapro, which helped the anxiety but destroyed my mental focus
- Valerian root or other such plants which does nothing
- Sports. I switched to an active lifestyle, doing intense sessions of either running or weight lifting. While it seems to stabilize my mood a bit through the day, the old problems remain.

*If my post looks familiar, I reached out on the mental health subreddit as well to attempt reaching more people*. 

Hello everyone! I hope you are all having a good day today.

I come today in search of answers regarding my brains function. I have sat with a few different therapists and discussed it but we have not gotten a great sense of what is going on yet.

Here are the characteristics, I will be keeping an eye on responses to answer questions as I feel this may not be enough information:

I am diagnosed with ADHD. I am not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but I often feel anxious.

Inside my head, I have no internal monologue or thoughts. It is almost as if everything I do is automatic. It has been this way for as long as I can remember. I am currently 21 years old and I am a male.

I do not experience feelings in a linear sense, I often have to create them based on justifiable situations to exhibit them. That being said, certain emotions do shine through. Things like fear or surprise. I have a regular pain tolerance and response.

There is definitely processing going on in the background somewhere, but I am not aware of it while it happens, only of the end result of that processing. This leads me to think it may be a treatable situation.

I have been told that I am fairly intelligent and quick thinking. I have also been told that I am creative.

Outstanding negative characteristics are being somewhat back and forth emotionally or switching up suddenly on my stances.

It is not unpleasant to live this way, it just kind of feels like my life. As I type this post, I did not have forethought put into it I just type as the words pop up in my head. This often causes me to not be very concise.

Due to personal reasons I don't want to live anymore.,18,False,False,True,False,11,False,"I feel like this is never gonna end.
I'm so done at this point, it's not funny anymore.
I suffer from complex post-traumatic stress disorder aka c-ptsd.
I'm extremely cautious with people, I repress emotions without thinking about it, have a multitude of the strangest triggers (like a certain shade of yellow I.e.)
and I'm just generally quite unstable, not that anyone takes it seriously because I'm just too fricken polite to be an ass about it.

I might sound a little wierd with this but, I hate making people uncomftable. 
I'm communicative but  generally very careful to make sure no one worries about me.
That's definitely leftover from being bullied and growing up in a turbulent family to say the least.

I was hit with an intense flashback that induced a panicattack yesterday and took my emergency anti-psychotic meds - I took more then usual (still in the safety margin) and it basically made me super tired, bleary, quiet and slow which my family noticed.
I hated that so much, I explained it and everyone was  sympathetic, but the whole day I just wanted to be normal again.
That night I cried because I knew that no matter what I did, there's a slim chance I'll ever forget about the awful things that I had to live through.

I've been struggling for days with thoughts of suicide again (something I thought was  over, I was doing fine the last few weeks) because - my memories just haunt me, there's times where I feel like I can't even breathe or move, I'll be fine but then  hour later I'll be hysterically crying.
I'm in therapy but I feel like the amount of trauma I have, personally is just critical mass.
Everyday I just feel like I'm dragging something out that isn't worth it.
I'm tired, I'm hurting and I've tried everything to fix it.

I know that the people that love me want me to keep going, and I want to keep going for them but I'm just at my limits.
My quality of life has hit a low point a long time ago.

This will kill me at some point.
I just feel like, whenever I tell people I've had enough and I wanna die the responses are threefold:

_""you don't mean that""_

I'm sorry, but I do - If a doctor told me he could put me down I would be on a chair waiting in a second.

_""you just need to give it time and talk to someone""_

I've been doing that since I knew I could. It soothes but it doesn't heal.

_""you should try to apprechiate life more""_ 

I do, I apprechiate life so much that I've come atleast this far, I don't hate the world or the people around me. I think this world is beautiful and while I might sound hypocritical I encourage anyone I meet to do better and be kind, I see potential in them and humanity at large.
I'm too sensitive, I feel too deep and too intensely.
I'm not made to be here - and if at some point I was then my trauma made me lack the stability to be a happy, functioning member of society.

Its a problem with me, not everyone else.

I can't blame anyone for telling me these things, I honestly would say basically the same stuff to anyone that told me that.

I don't know what else to add - I'm just done, I've had my fill.
I want to live but at this point life has stopped being a sacred cow to me.
I just want it to be over.

The Journey to You (117),0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"We start off not knowing anything. **Do we really ever?** 

Life is about lived experiences. Its more important than a degree or diploma. Lived experiences will then give you the tools to be able to face what is needed that isn't learned through books.

Its interesting how we think we need to go to school to be successful and hey, if thats your focus then **GO ALL IN,** but for the ones that are going to school because they are told to. That, that is the only way they will be successful, I call **BULLSHIT.** 

Lived experiences will forever be the most important part of life. For me, I found myself by going to school, but by realizing that the life that could be followed after was not for me and was never for me. A little hypocritical? or is it exactly what I shared initially with a narrow focus? 

**Lived experiences.** Through school, it made me focus on everything I was passionate about that had nothing to do with school. Through school, it made me focus on who I am and now leading up to this very moment, where I can proudly say that **I AM TRANS.** We all have different paths, we all have different journeys, but we all can relate to one another in some way and use another perspective to influence our own, for us all to grow, **Together, Separately.**

Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this.

Every suicide is a triumph of free will and human dignity over the most useless science ever invented.,11,False,False,True,False,8,False,"IT took me 20 years to recognize that I was depressed and another 10 to actually do something about it, by seeing a therapist and taking Sertraline. My problem was and is that I suck at life. I got by on 20min of work/day in school, but that changed and I didn't, so I failed at most of the things I started, including a 6-year relationship, two attempts at college and a company. 

Last fall I finally faced the music and got on Sertraline. I always told people that there should be no stigma attached, that it does not change your personality etc. Boy was I wrong. Yes, I felt happier for a while. I also slept about 18h a day. I did not even notice it, until about two weeks ago I was simply (once again) too lazy to refill the prescription. When I went cold turkey I suddenly noticed how much the meds had changed me, and not in a good way.

To put it in simple terms: I had gone stupid. Whereas before and – to a limited degree now again – I was good with words, charismatic and convincing I had become dull. When I talked to people, it felt like something wasn't right, something was off. My imagination was nonexistant, my creativity stunned. I had become bored by my own thoughts, but remained unable to come up with new ones.

I am deeply unhappy now. But for some reason I am somewhat productive again, the fog that I did not even notice has cleared. I am not a good person, but at least I am a person. When after 150 years of trying modern psychology still can't help a somewhat simple case of depression such as mine, maybe they should finally give up. But they're probably too happy to see how much they suck and to ""gritty"" to look in the mirror and evaluate themselves.

Day 7: Waking up at 6AM,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Today was the most difficult day, and I let my alarm ring for way too long, but I had also anticipated it would be difficult days 7-10. I'm trying to learn how to observe my feelings and negative thoughts with detachment, so that even when it really really sucks and I don't want to do something like get out of bed, I'm able to do it. I woke up at 5:30am randomly because my room was too cold and I was sniffing and sneezing. It is also gloomy, foggy, cloudy, and rainy in Vancouver. So even though I wake up at 6AM, I don't see any sign of like until about 8AM. Which really sucks, but again, is also merely another obstacle and mental construction for me to overcome.  

And despite it being difficult to get up, I'm happy now that I did (which seems inevitable in any difficult task completed). Is it actually possible to do something very difficult which you've previously committed yourself to due to deep personal reasons, and then regret it in the future? Is it possible I will look back at this 6AM wakeup journey and regret the days I woke up at 6AM? It seems impossible, so I'm really confused about why we engage in illogical behavior often.

Could i be experiencing PTSD?,4,True,False,True,False,3,False,"The story goes like this. About a year and a half ago i left my home country with my at the time boyfriend because he had issues with the law and he had to pay a big fine so we left so we could earn the money to pay the fine. We arrived at his parents house (mom and stepfather). His mom is a party hound and so is his step father, the drink a lot and use extacy. One night his stepfather had taken some extacy. I was outside the house having a smoke and he came up to me and started talking about liking me and that if he would be 10 years younger and so on. I didn't want to listen to his crap so i decided to leave, but he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me in his lap and started grabbing my breasts and butt. I struggled to get away from him but i managed to get away. I ran into the kitchen and started crying. Thankfully we wrere leaving the next day.After that i had some panic attacks at random times and sometimes the memory just pops into my head and i am so angry at that moment. 

After this we left and everything was ok kind of ok. The problem was that my boyfriend didn't understand the panic attacks i had and how hard it was, on top of that he was terrorizing me, making a scene about every little thing, making demands and so on. Every day i was stressing about these things if he would throw a scene about something. He used to wake me up at night just so i would be tired and wouldn't be able to go to work, tried to isolate me from my friends and loved ones. After it started i had issues with my health and they got worse in time. I went to the doctor and did tests and there was nothing wrong with me and the doctor said it's psychological. After that i started to get better because i kind of felt good that there is nothing wrong with me physically, i just have to deal with my psychological issues. I did it pretty well, my health got better, i got stronger and everything was great. And finally i ran away from the guy, i couldn't take the terror anymore, so i ran back to my home country where i'm happy and i'm with someone.

Now the problem is i can't sleep. I go to sleep like always and i fall asleep easily, but i wake up 2-5 times a night and i'm exhausted in the morning. I wake up because i don't feel physically comfortable but it feels like the pose is uncomfortable. I also have a reoccurring dream that i'm running to the country i left and also back to my home country and i'm always in a rush and scared that i'll miss the plane. Does anyone have any ideas why i don't feel rested in the mornings and have problems sleeping? 

P.S. The part where the guy was waking me up during the night so i wouldn't leave for work in the morning was happening for a month and it was the last month i stayed with him and then i ran away.

Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response,503,False,False,True,False,44,False,"
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your “I don’t need anyone, I’ll just do it all myself” conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you “we’re in this together” or “I got you” then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn’t really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don’t put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won’t have to be disappointed when they don’t show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don’t trust anyone.

And you don’t trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

“Never again,” you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it’s your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It’s a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, “You rest. I got this.” And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don’t have to earn it.
You don’t have to prove it.
You don’t have to bargain for it.
You don’t have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.
Simply because you exist.

Wife is Venezuelan, we’ve been together 7 years married 2 going on 3. We started with her lawyer for her work permits and everything and my dad said he had a friend ( never making this mistake again ). Dad said he will pay and everything so we told the other lawyer if we needed anything we will contact her in the future. Here’s the short part :
Been almost 2 years so about 5 years ago. Since he started. She lost her job 6 months ago, I’ve lost all of our savings paying for the new lawyer. Had to move back in with my MIL and FIL (not bad they love me and I love them) even though I’m a very independent person. As soon as I graduated at 18 I moved out with my (then girlfriend) wife to an apartment. Just found out from new lawyer because I’ve had suspicions that this should have only taken a week to submit. Square one. Guess this is more of a vent sorry. I’m so tired and over all this, credit cards maxed out. Everything just sucks man, I can’t even fix the cavity in my mouth rn. Some lawyers suck.

30 mental models that will make you more successful in life,244,False,False,True,False,35,False,"Mental models are magical.

Once you learn one, you start seeing it everywhere. It changes your thinking forever.

They make you understand the world and human nature better.

Here are 30 of them with their short explanations:

# 1. Antifragility   

We know fragile things. They break easily with a little stress and disorder. 

Antifragile things don’t just resist a shock, damage, or crisis but also thrive under these conditions. It’s a concept developed by Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile.  


https://preview.redd.it/wumdik5ifm091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=100b86894b1dbab7c47660531a563c289a7484b5

# 2. Redundancy  

Efficiency brings hidden risks. Not only for supply chains but also for your life.   

Redundancy is not only insurance when the crisis comes, but also a way to benefit from it.  

Extra cash, multiple income streams, and survival skills are good examples.

# 3. Input Goals   

Most of the goals you set are output goals, based on outcomes (becoming a millionaire or getting a six-pack).   

But the outcomes are never under your control.   

Focus on input goals to achieve your goals.  


https://preview.redd.it/8b9sd0orfm091.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4393e847340aaaabf0141aa4db1c40e16ea890a

&#x200B;

# 4.  Information Arbitrage   

Everybody has specific knowledge that they can leverage by trading or using it.   

Information Arbitrage is benefitting from the knowledge gap between you and others.

# 5.  Fosbury Flop:   

Dick Fosbury changed the high jump when he rejected to listen to people who say “We’ve always done it this way.”   

He looked for a better way and invented his own style (jumping backward) to dominate the high jump. 

What can be your Fosbury Flop?

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/aiyvj1hyfm091.gif

&#x200B;

# 6. Exponential Thinking   

Our brains think incrementally by default.   

But as Astro Teller Said: “It’s usually easier to make something 10x better than it is to make it 10% better.”

# 7. Minimum Viable Product   

You define what is the minimum, what is viable, and what is the product before starting working on a project.   

It’s a common practice in software development.   

But, it's applicable in different aspects of your life to avoid perfectionism.

# 8. The 5/25 Rule   

List the 25 things you want to achieve.   

Decide on the 5 most important ones from the list.   

Now you have 5 goals that you’ll focus on this year.   

What will you do with the rest? You’ll avoid them **at all costs**.

# 9. Compartmentalization   

Napoleon’s secret to handling many complex topics with full attention.   

It’s not multitasking; it’s extreme **unitasking**.

# 10. Resistance   

Steven Pressfield’s villain from his book The War of Art.   It’s a force inside you that would like to keep things the same. You feel it whenever you’d like to do something useful.   It shows its face in the form of procrastination, fear, or anxiety.

# 11. The 80/20 Rule

20% of the causes create 80% of the outcomes.  

Identify 20% of the activities that give you 80% of the results.  

If it’s a positive outcome activity (investments) focus on that 20%.  

If it’s negative (causes of stress, bad health) eliminate that 20%.

# 12. Leverage   

Leverage —as a concept— is getting the maximum output with the same resources.   

As [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval) says, the modern world gives us two magical (and cheap) tools to use leverage: code and media.  

Labor and money are two other forms of leverage.

# 13. The Snowball Effect   

The power of compounding. Money, effort, and knowledge compound in the long term in ways you cannot imagine.  

You can get the benefits of the snowball effect only if you're patient and don't interrupt the snowball’s momentum.

Warren Buffett's net worth is a great example:

# 14. Second-Order Thinking   

Every decision has consequences. But consequences also have consequences.   

Second-order thinking is evaluating not only the apparent first-order consequences; but the events that can occur following them.

https://preview.redd.it/75njk5lhgm091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab9e668ff11951c52da55640f4cd5f2186206a2f

&#x200B;

# 15. Inverse Thinking   

When options are broad, making the right decision is hard.   

Inverse thinking makes it easier by **avoiding the negative**.   

So instead of: “What should I do to be happy in my life?” Ask: “What are the things that would make my life miserable?"" And avoid them.

# 16. Regret Minimization Framework  

Jeff Bezos’ mental model to make big life decisions. Before founding Amazon he projected himself as 80 years old.   

Would his old self regret not joining the internet wave and selling books online?   

After this framing, the decision was easy.  


https://preview.redd.it/zy993ljngm091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=809be2a1d11874d6bb3d3298238b7080ebfeb635

# 17. Via Negativa  

As Nassim Taleb puts it solution through **subtraction**.   

Instead of looking for things to add to a system, a project, or your life, you look for things to eliminate.   Want to improve your health?   

Don’t buy supplements; remove smoking, sugar, and drinking first.

# 18. A-B-Z Framework  

Having a long-term goal for yourself is good.   

But it's overwhelming when you think about how to get there.   

So instead: Assess where you are (A), set your direction (Z), and decide on your immediate next step (B).   Take that action.

# 19. Personal SWOT Analysis   

SWOT is a tool that executives use to have situational awareness of their companies: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  

Personal SWOT **paints a picture of your life** and allows you to find the best path for yourself.  


https://preview.redd.it/pzn2d5jwgm091.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af82b40bbd208fe6c33f1177e52f5cfc352646eb

# 20. 10-10-10 Rule   

Ask how you’ll feel about a decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.   

Makes your decision easier by showing you some of the second-order effects.

# 21. Halo Effect   

People do judge a book by its cover.  

If you experience something positive at first (nice packaging of a product or well-dressed person), you intuitively have a better feeling about **all other aspects** of that brand or person.

It's one of Apple's marketing principles. That's why they've been paying attention to **all details** of the brand; the packaging of iPhones, the design of its stores, and new product presentations…

# 22. Commitment Bias   

Your mind tries to be consistent with your past actions and words.   

So people get stuck with ideas, investments, or business decisions that don’t make sense anymore.   

Only because they had committed to them with their money, effort, or words.

# 23. Hindsight Bias   

After we know how things turned out, our minds ignore all other possibilities and explain the past as it was inevitable.   

Plus it creates false confidence.   

People think if it’s easy to explain all past events they can also predict the future.

https://preview.redd.it/j5h8b072im091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e538116b9cd0ef7860877cedd31dfd72ac8345

&#x200B;

# 24. Concorde Fallacy   

Thinking like a losing gambler. 

People allow the **past cost** of something to influence their decisions today.   

Concorde project was a great example of it: the British and French governments continued to spend billions on the project despite its obvious flaws.

https://preview.redd.it/643b2a65im091.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d35b747f0b84cdafff2056b3a4cbd3ac556c40ce

# 25. The Paradox of Choice   

After a certain level, each additional option makes your decision harder.   

More becomes less. Only limitations can help you to break it.   

It’s heavily used in marketing by reducing the options of potential customers.

# 26. Lindy Effect   

As we get older, we have less time to live.   

But ideas don’t have a life span. So the older an idea, a technology or a company gets, the longer it will live in the future. It’s **aging in reverse**.   

Examples: wheel (technology), Sun Tzu (ideas), and Coca-Cola (company).

# 27. Goodhart’s Law   

“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”   

Example: A support agent is incentivized for the results of a survey, not for the actual customer satisfaction.   

So an agent might be pushy —hence reducing satisfaction— to get more survey responses from customers.

# 28. Argumentum Ad Populum  

Latin for “appeal to the people.” 

It's a fallacy when people accept what is popular as true without logical reasoning.   

“University education is necessary for success.” is an example.   

We take it from society without thinking it through ourselves.

# 29. Parkinson’s Law  

Projects expand to fill the time available for their completion.   

So even if the project with a two-week deadline could be finished in three days, you’d still tend to use all the time you have.   

And the additional time wouldn’t even improve the quality.

# 30. The 10/1 Rule   

For every active social media account on any platform, there are around 9 passive accounts.   

It means whatever your skills and interests are, the moment you start actively sharing; you leave 90% of people behind in your area.

Safe spaces in the workplace for the socially anxious,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi there,

I have extremely context specific social anxiety and that is in the workplace. When I’m at my desk I feel almost paralysed with shyness. I hear people speaking around me and I want to contribute, but then the fear of being judged washes over me. 

However, when I’m with my colleagues away from my desk, say, in the kitchen or even at a work lunch, I feel much better. It’s almost like they’re more of a safe space in the work arena for me and when I’m at my desk my nervous system is more on edge. Don’t get me wrong, the fear of being judged and self-consciousness is still there when I’m in these other environments with my colleagues, but it’s great alleviated when I am away from my desk.

Has anyone else experienced this? Outside the workplace I am usually quite good and don’t feel too worried about how other people perceive me. It’s just really centred around work because work is literally evaluative—if you don’t perform or fit in, you go. So it’s not an irrational fear like a lot of other anxiety is. It’s quite justified really.",False,False,socialanxiety,401690,Hot,2024,2,Very high,0,53,1054,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0
every strange thing that’s happened in the last 24 hours. please read .,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41521,Hot,2023,3,Low,0,71,3772,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0

How to support your love ones with mental illness,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"My parents, who emigrated from India to the United States, both worked as farmers to provide me with a brighter future and opportunities they never had. However, they were disappointed to learn of the various challenges I have encountered, despite their best efforts. As a bisexual individual coping with mental illness, I found myself feeling isolated, as my family’s conservative beliefs and immigrant work ethic did not lend themselves to discussing these topics openly. I yearned for the day when I could fearlessly introduce myself as “Ria Patel”, embracing all facets of my identity without the fear of judgement or rejection. But my fears proved unfounded when my parents embraced me with open arms and encouraged me to seek help for my mental illlness, recognizing that living in America could offer hope and the promise of a better future. Thus, I sought out treatment and learned that I was suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression-diagnoses that both confirmed and alleviated my struggles. Receiving my diagnosis brought me to tears, not from sadness, but from validation. The Indian community had made me feel like my mental health struggles were a form of madness, but the diagnosis showed that I had a treatable condition. With renewed purpose, I sought help through therapy and medication, which helped me reclaim my well-being. Yet the question always remained, why am I the only Indian that grappled with these challenges? But I wasn’t the only one. I was one of the few willing to openly discuss the topic. To address this lack of dialogue and raise awareness in South Asian communities, I founded a non-profit organization called Project Shakti. Project Shakti aims to combat the stigma surrounding mental health in South Asian cultures, which stems from a lack of knowledge and understanding about mental illness. Many people in these cultures may not recognize warning signs or may be hesitant to seek help due to misconceptions about mental health being a sign of weakness or shame. As part of Project Shakti's mission to promote engaging mental health education, I established a Redbubble account offering merchandise that promotes awareness of mental illness and a donation page supporting the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Our organization's blog offers multiple perspectives on mental health to combat isolation, while the PS Story podcast shares a teenager's unique perspective on coping with mental illness. Additionally, we are launching a children's book that emphasizes the importance of accepting mental illness at any age. Project Shakti's message of embracing individuality and acceptance deeply resonates with my experiences of navigating the challenges of being diagnosed. I hope to contribute to a community that empowers individuals to celebrate diversity and embrace their unique identities. Because that to me is embracing the American dream.

1. This is reposted but is my own post
2. I apologize if I mislabel this post

I understand the title is a bit confusing, so let me explain. I have a friend (whom I won't describe for privacy reasons) whom I recently met about two months ago. We both got it off quite well as friends and soon, started sharing traumatic experiences during late-night conversations. For context, I was SA'd twice during 2022 and still haven't gotten therapy for it. All this, along with a nasty rumor being spread about me and getting cheated on, led me to be desperate for friends and social interactions. What I'm scared about, is I think I'm becoming too desperate for attention. I have terrible nights sometimes and will text them about how I'm hurting myself, effectively manipulating them into giving me attention. I feel horrible for this and I believe this greed is seeping into our day conversations as well. They mentioned to me after a moment we had (I'm not sure what to call it, but I was taking everything they said out of context and using it to put myself in the negative light I thought I deserved, and they were responding with how those feelings were nothing special to them) and said that during the entire thing I was guilt tripping them. I seem to do this without even noticing and it needs to stop. 

Is there anything I can do? I have more friends outside of just them, but they're the only ones who have mentioned it.

Veteran (27m) told me he loved me (28f) and then left. Does PTSD make you block out love?,0,False,False,True,False,16,False,"
I’ve been dating this guy for two months. He is a veteran. He treated me like a Queen for two months. It was genuine, he was a gentleman with very traditional values. I don’t trust words or actions, I trust my intuition. As an empath, I felt his love.  Last week, he confessed that he had a gut feeling that he had met his future wife the moment he met me. I was a little sleep deprived that day, so he told me to reflect on it once I’ve had some sleep and get back to him in a day or two (about whether or not I want to give this relationship a proper go). I got back to him two days later and said I was open to giving it a go and seeing where life takes us. He got so happy, called me, and wanted to see me then and there. I said I couldn’t cos I had other plans. He then made all these bookings for the week ahead (movies, a play etc). I then got Covid and couldn’t see him for a week, all our plans got cancelled. I finally recovered and he took me out to dinner. After dinner, he sat me down and said that he hadn’t slept for three nights. He said he felt anxiety about us, that maybe his body was telling him something. He said he didn’t feel good enough for me/was worried about hurting me (I’ve already been through enough as I have lost both parents to cancer). He said he was confused about how he felt about me, that it wasn’t black or white but grey. He said he wanted to end things. He said “it’s not anxiety or depression or anything”…and somewhere in passing he mentioned “not having the will to live”. He said he didn’t have PTSD from the army but struggled with his emotions after it and got help. He said he couldn’t feel emotions properly after the army but got help for it. I said to him “is this because you don’t love me? Just say it” and he said “I can’t sat I don’t love you, I’d be lying”. I begged him to tell me he didn’t love me, but he couldn’t say it. He walked away and then came back and held me and kissed my forehead and said he was going to pray for me. He held me for like 15 mins and wouldn’t leave until I went inside. I was so shocked.

I have no idea what is wrong with me but I want to change it.,77,False,False,True,False,22,False," 

I'm kinda mentally exhausted at the moment but I am going to try and keep this concise. I suffer from some pretty severe anxiety. I constantly have thoughts running through my head every day saying ""You're a bad person. You deserve death. You don't deserve anything good. No one likes you."" I almost daily feel like the world doesn't like me or wouldn't like me if they knew me. I become terrified at this thought. I tell myself over and over that I am a pretty good person and that no one is talking about you and most people wouldn't hate you but it's like this noise that just won't go away. I can barely partake in any activity without it popping up. It distracts me from almost everything in my life.

I can't tell you exactly when this feeling started but after a bad falling out with friends a couple of years ago, my anxiety got worse. Basically I wanted to improve my life and that meant leaving some people behind, which in turn, hurt them pretty bad. I feel like since then, I've had more isolation and more introspective and now that I have some time to think, I've realized how bad I think of myself. How bad my self-esteem is and how insecure I really am.

I live alone, having lost both of my parents within the past year. I work from home and of course, during this pandemic, I can't really go out so as far human contact, that's not an option. I have some friends I talk to every day through messaging but I feel like my thinking is completely out of whack. I'll have these brief moments of clarity where it feels like everything is okay and back to normal, and then in an instant, it's all gone. I'm desperate to fix this and get back to living normally.

I can't honestly say if any of this makes any sense but I kinda just wanted to pour everything out and see what happens.

Any ideas about this ? 

Got it after 2 months of no contract.  



Hi (@##)  ! I just wanted to tell you what was going on and not ghost you. I found your old messages and finally opened up to some people about what happened in this relationship. I think it only could exist because of my own trauma that said I didn't deserve better and I mistook empathy for love and such, and I'm still treating these wounds and hope to never meet you again. So, I will just say that I have and had a crazy amount of empathy for you and that I wish you all the best and know you will get that.

It was emotional violence that you did, and you crossed my sexual boundaries more than once, I know you didn't mean to most of the time, and you are working on these patterns, but the work wasn't enough. The push and pull dynamic was because I wanted to fix it and make it go away, but it only made it worse. Since it's my own trauma, I will not pull again .

Update:
I might be venting, but here's the situation: I consider myself a very simple person, and I'm expressing my concerns here because I want to make sure that I am not a ""monster ""as my inner voice telling me so . I feel guilty after reading the message, as if it was intended for someone else and I was an easy target or a manifestation of along history of bad ex's  

Regarding the sexual abuse aspect, we had a normal sexual life where she was into BDSM, had a history with fetish parties, and engaged in sexual behaviour in that context. Since I'm not into BDSM (but have nothing against it), I tried some things she said she liked, and she never told me to stop or voiced any concerns. I wasn't aware of what went wrong until later. I was shocked because I received positive feedback all the time, but I still apologized and didn't argue.

As for the emotional abuse, I believe it was related to my social media behavior, where my Instagram feed included some women (whom I don't know personally, but that's how the algorithm works). This made her jealous, and she emotionally withdrew, which led to me spending a lot of energy trying to mend things. On the other hand, she posted a picture of herself in a pole dancing suit (as she is a pole dancer).

She also became jealous of my ex-girlfriend, who visited me during a period of psychiatric quarantine following a suicidal attempt. However, she herself invited me to a musical concert where her ex was playing, which I found out about later.

The main reason for our breakup was that I didn't want her to dance in a fetish party, but she went ahead and did it anyway. So, I told her we were done and asked her not to contact me again. Despite that, she kept texting me, and we had an on-and-off relationship filled with accusations and guilt trips until I decided to stop texting altogether. This led to us ghosting each other for two months until I received this message.",False,False,ptsd,100207,Controversial,2023,8,Medium,3,13,2877,neutral,negative,False,False,0,1,0

As we walk our path in life, we are often eager to see what will come in the future. We want to feel safe about the future and decide exactly how we want it to be. The reality is that the future is outside our control, and there is nothing we can do about it. Accept this fact, accept this uncertainty, and shift the focus back to this moment. Your only chance to change the future is to change what you are doing in this moment. This is it; now is your time; now is everything.

I suffer from suicidal ideation, CPTSD, PCOS and IBS. 

Lost my part time video editing job because couldn't reach the deadlines due to my depressive episodes, (seeing a psychiatrist for the same at AIIMS) have been really suffering financially since, I can't even afford generic medicines. I have been to interviews but I get rejected every time because my anxiety gets really bad during the interview no matter how much I prepare. 

I never worked on building my resumé/career because of executive dysfunction from the depression, and I did the part time jobs to ""buy time"" so that I can get better but I didn't, and now I feel that I've ended my career before it started because I don't really have anything valuable for my resumé.

my best friend is hurting themselves and i don’t know how to help,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"we are both teens living in southern US, and have both struggled with our mental health since we were in our early teens. for context we met online, living in neighboring states. 

my parents are supportive, open-minded individuals, who got me help very quickly. things were unfortunately not the same for my friend. 

both of our families aren’t very fortunate when it comes to money, i have Medicaid because of this. my friend’s family does not meet the requirements for Medicaid, despite the fact that they are roughly in the same financial situation as me, with the same number of people in the house. their state has different eligibility requirements. their state, and specifically their location in the state leaves little room for good options of mental healthcare.

however within the last year, my friend was able to get to a doctor (although not a psychiatrist) who has since prescribed a number of medications, all which have not worked for them. 

they are not the greatest with habitually and routinely taking these medications, which could be part of the reason they’ve made them feel worse/not helped at all. or alternatively, the medications truly make them feel worse, and as a result they don’t like to take them. 

only recently have i become aware of their self harm, and this is one of the reasons i took to seek help here. 

i was put on antidepressants when i was about 14, and they’ve worked for me. i’ve only switched medications once, and gone up on dosage a handful of times, and while i think sometimes i could be doing better, i know that my friend’s mental state has deteriorated more than mine and at a much faster pace. 

i have never self harmed, while in the past i had the urge to, i always ultimately decided against it, and found an alternative to processing my emotions. i had also always been paranoid that if i ever did harm myself, my parents would find out, and i never wanted to subject them to that. 

my friend however does not have the relationship that i have with my parents, they barely pay attention to friend, and only recently has friend admitted to hurting themselves to their mother. 

as much as i hate to say it, i don’t believe my friends parents care about them as much as my parents care about me. and i believe this may be one of the many reasons my friend is struggling. 

my friend very recently admitted to me that they attempted to take their life, and this has left me helpless. 

this friend is my absolute everything, a life without them in it would not make sense. i don’t want to lose them to this battle, but i don’t know what to do to help since i’ve never been in this situation. 

sorry for being incredibly vague with everything but i don’t want to give too much information away. i just felt like i needed help, and i didn’t know who to ask.",False,False,mentalhealth,443572,Hot,2024,2,Very low,0,65,2817,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0

I am unwell and dont know what to do,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I genuinely want to know what went wrong in my life for me to have ended up this way. I have been in a constant state of sadness for quite a while and I am struggling to figure out where is stems from. I have also been feeling really dumb, I have started to forget things extremely easily, I can no longer remember names or things I said minutes ago, I can't focus at all and I can't understand basic school knowledge. I can no longer do maths as I used to, I can't even hold a short conversation with someone due to my severe anxiety, but also because I just can't process what they are saying anymore.

It's terrible because I remember being considered a good student back in middle school, back when I had my moments of sparkling wit, now I have become a very boring, passive and limp person who hates herself. 
Another symptom I have noticed as a result to this constant state of sadness was a very random psychological change that has made me a lot more emotional and overall a lot more empathetic, which is a good thing to a certain extent. It feels like my brain has been completely shut down and only my heart is functioning. With this though, I have started feeling guilt on an astronomical level for a long while now. I started caring about people on an unhealthy level. I feel guilty for the people who waste their energy on me, I feel guilty for my thoughts and for what I say sometimes. I feel guilty whenever I keep a secret from someone even though it doesn't even concern them sometimes. And yeah, I have also become a lot more emotional, I cry for no reason sometimes, even thought I am sure there is a reason, I just haven't been able to identify it. I feel like my brain is purposefully trying to keep me from finding out why I feel like this. 
At this point, I just want my mind to give me a break. I feel like I want to maybe become better deep down, even though I act as if I have given up on putting effort into my studies and trying to just better myself. I just don't know what to do at this point. It's genuinely sad because I am only 18 and I feel so tired and stripped of all my youthful energy, I just have no energy left in me. The only times I smile is when I think about my amazing parents and my loving boyfriend. I am just emotionally exhausted and I dont know why.

My boyfriend undressed me without asking.

One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life.

Support Groups For Mental Illness,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hey guys I’ve been struggling a lot with my mental health. I have adhd and with that comes really bad pathological demand avoidance, anxiety, and depression. It’s been kicking my ass recently to the point where all I’m thinking about is dying. One of my main issues is my lack of community. My dad kicked me out and was distant with his side of the family whereas my mom is racist (I’m half black, she’s white, my dad is black) and her side of the family always has abusive men or drug addicts around. So I don’t talk to either side of my family. My two bestfriends stopped being friends with me because I asked if we could work on our relationship cuz I was constantly left out when they went on trips. So my one bestfriend who was living with me skipped out on rent and I haven’t heard from either of them since. They were really my only friends because I recently moved to a new state and they were the friends I had before I moved. Then my new roommate was my friend until she started acting weird because of her bf who has an assault and domestic violence charge and has also said very weird and shady things. He isolates himself which makes her feel obligated to isolate with him cuz he won’t spend time with her otherwise. She also said the N word after we had talked about how wrong it is for white people to say that (you may not agree but it’s the boundary we had set months beforehand). So now that friendship is pretty much gone. I need a community. People who understand me. People who agree with me that life sucks and it’s unfair and too hard for no reason. I need people to lean on so if anyone knows how to find a support group for this issue it would be really great. I think if I had more people to talk to other than my bf then I would feel more anchored to this life. I live in Baltimore, MD so if anyone knows of any ore-existing support groups around me please let me know. If not, can anyone let me know how to find the groups?",False,False,mentalillness,149336,New,2024,2,Very low,0,33,1951,neutral,positive,False,False,0,0,0
Need advice regarding music as a habit..,2,False,False,True,False,3,False," 

Hi all, so i dont even know if this is the correct place to post.

Alas, i thought its better to try and maybe someone in here could provide the help i require.

Require.. well that is not completely acccurate, you see i am 30 years old. I have been trying to make music for quite many years now. I have recorded some songs with some childhood friends of mine, (no longer friends) one of those friends was my producer, he produced the songs i wrote to them and we recorded in his home studio.

Now i still want to try and pursue my dreams of making it through music... well dreams i mean i dream about it however i never get things done... mostly because i am a perfectionist and i feel like i need to produce, so i need to learn how to do that, which i have gotten myself ableton, profesionnel studio monitors, a keyboard, a souncard, proffesional sounding plugins. Yet i cant get myself to produce... i feel so demotivated and lazy and i hate myself for it....

I keep proscraniating with everything else... i have bought a bullet journal and pen and stickers and markers, to make my bullet journal ""oh so productive and pretty"" well now i sit writing in that but not getting things done, and i havent written lyrics in so long because i have been overwhelmed trying to produce and not getting things done, so now i also feel out of touch with writing lyrics....

I know this sounds like a 3 year olds ranting and whining, the thing that bothers me most is that, in my mind i think i have a clear picture of what i want. So lets take a regular week, i would want to play some keyboard monday to practice piano, tuesday i would try and dabble around in ableton (DAW = digital Audio workstation) and get comfortable producing, wednendsay i would try to write some lyrics.

And rinse and repeat troughout the week, however i dont know if im trying too much at once or if im just doing this whole ""blocking task"" wrong, or prioritizing wrong, i really dont know.

ive made it to a point where instead of trying to help myself, ive become lost in self help, and all their glorifying promises of ""productivity"" and ""morning routines"" etc...

Man i feel like back in the days i would simply do it, like just sit down and do the things i love, but now i feel everything is too overwhelming.

So phew... my question is this, do i need a system to help me organize these things i want to get done in a week? or is it simply sitting down and doing it, and if so how can i make sure i get through all the things i want to, both piano playing, producing, writing lyrics etc?

Sorry for the long rant and if you read a long all the way i truly thank you for taking the time!

Kind regards - a whiny 30 year old.",False,False,selfhelp,172412,Hot,2024,1,Low,0,40,2702,neutral,positive,False,False,0,0,0

He wasn't being hyperbolic or manipulative. I just walked into the house to him sobbing. Snot running down his face sobbing. 

He has autism. When he someone he loves is upset with him and he honestly can't see or understand why they are upset, he starts to hate himself. He thinks he's broken. He doesn't understand why he can't just understand why people are upset. So then he doesn't think he can do anything right. Since he can't understand how what he did led to your pain, he's afraid he is doomed to repeat the behavior until he loses you. 

We go through this same cycle anytime he upsets me. 

It's why I have encouraged him so emphatically to be in therapy. Which he is doing. 

But trust me when I say he wasn't being manipulative or hyperbolic. Upsetting you even a little bit makes him want to not exist. It isn't logical, but it is his reality.

HOW ANXIETY WAS GUIDING ME BACK TO SELF LOVE!!,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"It was the end of August 2019, two weeks passed since I experienced a severe anxiety attack out of nowhere..the worst bit was I had no idea how it started, why it was there or how to get rid of it..I was experiencing “HELL” on earth.

Fluctuating from extreme panic to extreme numbness 24/7 with no light at the end of the tunnel, I felt unsafe, like I wasn’t in my own body, watching myself from a distance, everything felt fake..like a bad nightmare waiting to wake up and be anxiety free.. but this wasn’t a nightmare, this became my reality.

My anxiety worsened, so me and my girlfriend at the time drove to her family shack out of town..I felt embarrassed & ashamed that my girlfriend was witnessing me in such a fragile and weak state.

To make me feel worse..I was a gym owner helping others get healthy bodies & a mindset coach helping people gain clarity & have emotional stability (talk about feeling like a fraud)

People came to me with their issues, I was the stable person to rely on..and here I was, completely broken!

My thoughts were:

“look how pathetic and weak I look”
“real men don’t feel like this”
“you’re a fucking loser”

I had mindset tools to erase my debilitating anxiety..so I got to work with my tools around midday at the shack, sitting down with a pen and paper, full of hope, but got worried when my anxiety wasn’t disappearing, not even the slightest.

In fact it increased so bad, I considered rushing to the nearest mental hospital to stop the terror. I realized how someone could consider committing suicide, as this floated through my mind to relieve pain..Instead I managed to drag myself inside the shack.

Curling up on the ground in a fetal position, rocking & shaking with a blank stare hoping for a miracle to save me.

I realized THE FEAR I HAD WAS PEOPLE FINDING OUT WHO THE TRUE ME WAS

A FRAUD & A WEAK MAN...who everyone believed had his shit together.

My imagination wouldn’t stop spiraling out of control with irrational thoughts, thoughts of getting trapped in a mental facility for the rest of my life, losing my loved ones around me for being a burden.

In the fetal position, I'm glimpsing my girlfriend look unsettled and uneasy, unsure of what to do, seeing her expressions confirmed my belief that I’m a failure as a MAN.

She even told me out of fear & concern “You’re a mindset coach, fix this!” wanting this to end for both of us, I was stuck on how to get out of this nightmare, how to make it through unscathed..
I felt at the very least I'll be mentally fucked for the rest of my life.

Saying to myself and the universe..

“IF I SOMEHOW MAKE IT THROUGH THIS, I PROMISE TO HELP OTHERS GET THROUGH THE SAME, NO ONE DESERVES THIS”
-

Up until this moment I took on the role of the rescuer, fixer, helper & hero for others. As a young boy I watched mum have emotional outbursts, and I would make her emotions my responsibility because her feeling happy made me feel happy and safe

So growing up I learnt the only way to feel safe and happy was to take on people's worries, emotions, concerns and make them my RESPONSIBILITY to fix..It was also the only way I knew how to feel important, special, needed, worthy of love and significant

It was my IDENTITY.. And I was great at it.. So great I made a living out of it..the downside was spending my life with anxiety by taking on people's stuff and thinking it was NORMAL.

-
I ended up falling asleep in a fetal position from exhaustion at the shack.

Over the next 3 months I dedicated every spare second researching, hiring top coaches & attending events..spending over $8,000 & still no relief from my ANXIETY.

Mind you, I was no beginner, already spending $45,000+ on personal development in the previous years.
-

Losing hope & feeling helpless, believing no one knew how to help me, I sold my gym & left my girlfriend, not feeling stable enough for them both. My whole life was gone, I felt like an empty and lifeless anxious shell. I had hit rock bottom
-

Then on the 8th January 2020,

Still searching for answers,
I came across an interesting comment in a Facebook group about anxiety

“to heal anxiety, we must learn to get back into the body”
“doing cognitive work alone will NOT heal anxiety, we must feel it to heal it”
“we need a bottom-up approach”

When I read this, my intuition was screaming at me “this is the missing piece you’re looking for.. MESSAGE THEM” So I messaged them on Facebook saying I wanna learn more.

It was all clicking and making so much sense with stuff I never heard of before..knowing this was the missing piece to healing my anxiety, I signed up to an event in 30 days' time.

The problem was still being so anxious and panicky that I wasn’t sure how I was going to get on a plane.. on the day I decided to suck it up and get on the plane anyways!

At the event I learnt the anxiety I was experiencing, was my “wounded inner child” waiting for me to rescue him..Instead of rescuing him, I had been doing everything possible to avoid him..I rescued others and distracted myself from the wounded boy inside of me.

Rescuing others made me feel significant, lovable, worthy & important..but it was the little boy inside of me who needed me the most.

I realised that my emotional needs weren't met in childhood (at no fault of my parents) 
showing up as anxiety, worry, panic throughout my ENTIRE life..And at 28 years old the little boy inside me had enough of not feeling seen, heard, validated and loved.. 

HE WAS SCREAMING OUT FOR HELP!

I was skeptical at first thinking..
“Are you fucking serious.. a little child is inside of me waiting?”

-
But the moment I went back to greet my wounded “LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD AARON” I couldn’t believe it..

There he was!

5 years old, at a birthday getting made fun of by his older brother and others for playing footsies under the table with a 5 year old girl (again no blame for my brother as that’s what big brothers do) 

Little Aaron feeling embarrassed, ashamed, rejected, abandoned, scared, hurt, betrayed, conflicted & overwhelmed..

Feeling unlovable, like something was wrong with him..this was the moment he built a cage around his little heart, not letting love in or out as it’s not safe..

This is where he learnt to not trust his emotions,
to never let himself feel exposed and vulnerable again,
to not be himself as it’s not safe,
to never let people see his soft and feminine side.

I then had an overwhelming rush of unconditional love rush throughout my entire body for little Aaron. I couldn’t believe how perfect.. how innocent..how lovable.. how special he was.

With tears rolling down my cheeks in a room full of people, I told him what an amazing little human he is & grew up to become. I felt my heart explode wide open, I felt the cage around his little heart melt away & anxiety pass through and leave his body.

I felt like I finally came back home to myself for the first time.. Back home where I belonged, where my inner child felt safe again.

-
I spent my life rescuing others, when the real person who needed rescuing the whole time was me, and only I could do that, no one had the ability to rescue me.

Abandoning little Aaron since childhood made him feel unsafe, unheard, unloved & insignificant, so I looked to rescue, help & fix others..It felt great until I NEEDED it again from the outside, keeping me trapped in a never ending cycle of helping others while neglecting myself.

I now feel the most safe in my body, aligned with purpose, worthy of love, stable, playful & joyful than ever before, anxiety no longer runs the show as I continue building the relationship with my inner child.

I promised myself if I made it through this I would help others in the same position..

Because anxiety makes us to feel like we’re a burden, letting down our loved ones, having constant racing thoughts & fearing we will be stuck like this forever

It causes us to feel ashamed, believing we are weak & failed because we couldn’t fix it on our own. 

But the biggest issue we have is believing we are unworthy of love. Us men deserve better

We deserve to heal our anxiety and reclaim control,
We deserve to regain our confidence & be proud of the MAN you are,
We deserve to feel safe in our own body,
We deserve to become an even better version of ourselves before anxiety took over.

But most of all we deserve to feel loved towards ourselves.

Committing to healing anxiety has been the single greatest thing I’ve done for myself, it has helped me improve the quality of my life, but by far the biggest impact has been the amount of self love I now have for myself.

Anxiety was guiding me back to self love, and it’s guiding us all back to that. Self love is the antidote to anxiety.

And the TRUTH is, you can heal your anxiety just like I did.",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55682,Controversial,2022,6,Very low,1,46,8776,positive,positive,False,False,0,1,0
"I don't know if this is anxiety, panic, anger or what",1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Recently I (24M) wasn't feeling that good. I felt like I'm at the verge of collapse and at moments I would start loosing contact with reality (no false beliefs or hallucinations, more like being numbed by intense negativity), but after going on a 'vacation' home for the carnival, I feel more stable. But now despite being stronger mentally, emotionally I feel like I should break apart from this thing I'm feeling, but I'm holding on naturally and just I don't know how to process this or get calm.

I have troubles with my parents, as they divorced after a really disgusting situation (I told them they should've divorced a long time even as a teenager) and now both of them, who live in the same house but different flats try to manipulate me to cause issues for the other one. Both of them try to get on the good terms with me occasionally for like two days in a row, and once they think they got on my good terms they start with their stories, which often include toying with my feelings of weakness, shame, and empathy. My mother (yuck) is an egoist and usually drops the facade when she sees I don't bulge (she's certainly a narcissist), while my father, lacking shame just continues with the bullshit, although he does get aggressive (verbally, but possibly physically) from time to time (he's likely a psychopath). Before this whole bullshit situation between them (a few years ago) I quit contact with my mom, saying that I don't know if she wants me good or harm, but that I want to distance myself, and I felt healthier than ever. It was the only time in my life where I felt like I was developing as a person. I even went on a date! But a few months later I had a student promotion and it felt wrong to not invite my family despite knowing my confusion and insecurity would return.

Now I can't do that, because my grandma's health would plummet. Staying only in contact with her is complicated, because I would indirectly be exposed to my family and often would receive questions about hating my mom, as she doesn't understand how fucked up that person probably is. She honestly believes no mother would want harm for her child. Or she is an actor in the whole plot. Idk, but probably not.

I have an exam tomorrow that I haven't studied much for. Obviously the reason for this feeling of urgency. I had troubles studying (and reading books in general) since the 6th grade as I would get angry and anxious when even thinking of a book, despite being a \*quick\* learner, which my mom attributed to my lack of discipline due to not needing to study beforehand. I have to note that I certainly \*do\* have discipline, and I \*think\* I proved on a few occasions I have much more discipline and concentration than most people when I have a strong enough motivation to overcome my anxiety when reading. My psychologist says that it isn't lack of discipline, but she didn't elaborate further. This is the last subject beside my master's thesis, and the second chance to get rid of it. Despite that I can't get myself to study enough time in advance, and I don't even get that adrenaline rush that allowed me to study whole subjects in a day or even a night beforehand. I actually kinda don't give a shit, and I partially believe my other life issues are more urgent to solve, as I can go to the exam on summer or even twice at autumn if needed. Still, it would've been so much easier if I was prepared for it tomorrow.

The few friends I have have distanced themselves from me. It's likely due to them being busy with both the work, study and a rich social life (friend says he wants a rest from people haha), but I cannot help but think I'm partially to blame as I don't have much to speak when unhappy and I kinda call them out just to alleviate the stress I feel, meaning I'm at the very least not the most rewarding person to go on a beer with. I do have a lot of non-close friends in the mountaineering group, but I struggle to have a fulfilling social encounters. I want to meet new people, but don't know how.

I'm also worried about my love life. Tbh I'm getting kinda obsessed with getting new romantic/sexual experiences when I'm down, and it causes me to feel lonely and be sexually frustrated (I have a high libido but had only one relationship). I don't know where to meet women, or even men as friends. While I know I would like a very serious relationship, I would be happy with a fwb thing if it's a \*real\* friend thing, but would also like to try anything new as long as it's safe.

I don't have hobbies that aren't exhausting. I'm a programmer, work as a programmer, study programming, and have ""hobby"" projects, but I need something else. I tried drawing (that was kid me's passion), but I don't have inspiration nor know how to put this feeling on paper. I actually always had issues with boredom, and supposedly my mother struggled to occupy me as a kid. I would be happy with more adventurous stuff (as most kids, and adult me), but kids (and people) around me weren't really adventurous. If it's a 6 minutes walk, it's too far (small town mentality). I plan on starting Muay Thai training soon, but I'm still afraid I won't have time for that. I want to discover an activity that would help me relax, as I think I'm not crazy, and that taking pills to reduce this anger would be wrong. I don't wanna be dependant on drugs, and I believe my anger and fear are more than rational.

\*\*The long story you might want to skip\*\*: >!Me and my ex broke up 3/4 months ago, a relationship that lasted a year and a half, that was a long distance relationship for over a year due to her going abroad to study. I wasn't happy with the relationship in the first place, and after spending more than a year sorting my head up so that I become certain I even want a \[monogamous\] relationship, I went crazy after slowly quitting the antidepressants that didn't do anything for me, but caused me to demonify over an afternoon if I forget to take the pill, all while being in the worst situation with the exams, stress over family, and trying to organize my visit to her during her graduation ceremony (I failed to do that). We fought as she thought I wasn't being considerate for her stress, and I stopped contact with her two times thinking I would be okay with never hearing from her due to immense stress and offense she gave me. That lasted two months before me quitting the pills completely and getting back to normal, after which we kinda started speaking again and decided that now that we are both together and stable we can try again, but with real effort to build a relationship this time. I was optimistic, but while thinking on calling it quits due to her lack of effort/incompatibility she dumped me (politely). I was somewhat okay with that, especially since she wanted to stay friends, and I felt that was the best form of our relationship, but since she was getting crazier, more frustrated, and would switch from calm to borderline psychotic in an instant when the conversation reminded her of her insecurities and jealousies during our relationship, I had to quit that friendship completely. She said she doesn't want to speak or be reminded of me for three months, so who knows what she would want next. Now THAT hurts me, because I never lose my emotions for people and I basically have to keep a friend dead in my heart while she is probably getting more and more mentally ill as she def wasn't healthy the last time we heard (calling me at 3am and not understanding that our talk will keep my roommates awake and preventing me from getting ready for bed. I practically had to close the call without a goodbye.)!<

\*\*TLDR\*\*: I don't know what I'm feeling, but I'm in a rut and feel trapped. I need new hobbies, but everything seems so complicated and I'm afraid I won't have time for them.

how do I deal with the fact that I have an incurable cancer?,0,False,False,True,False,11,False,"haven’t been diagnosed, but I know I have it. No one cares. My family doesn’t care, my school doesn’t care, the doctors don’t care. No one does. I’m just going to continue to slowly deteriorate until I finally have a seizure or a haemorrhage. Then I’m truly fucked.

I don’t understand why. I was only 12 when I found that mole. I didn’t do owt wrong. Yes, I was a cunt afterwards but I didn’t do nowt wrong when I were 12. It’s so bullshit. Now I’m 16 and I’m still a cunt but I don’t get why this is happening to me. I won’t even live to see my 17th birthday. It’s so bullshit. I will slowly rot in my room all on my own. And no one will care. By the time I’m diagnosed, I’ll either be dead or it will be far too late. And then I will only have a few days or weeks to live if I’m lucky.

So I will just rot alone. Wasting away. All alone. My future wasn’t very bright anyway. It’s all so fucked now. I could have gotten cured if I got the mole checked by a doctor or my swollen lymph node when I first found it.

My mom tried to end herself. ,7,False,False,True,False,4,False,"
Long story short, my mom tried to unalive herself and take me with her (in 7th grade)

She cried and begged me and told me things 
Before this incident she was still emotionally.. well I won't say abusive but, she was traumatized herself.

 (if I get 90% I am worthless, why did she give birth to me, she is going to die early because of me, if I don't do hw once bc I'm sick or anything she gaslighted me and told me ""if you are gonna do this then why don't you just end it? Just don't do anything"" -- screaming which ended with her crying and with dead eyes telling me reminding me I am going to be left alone with Noone besides me because she is going to die because of me etc etc) 


Anyways, back to ptsd,

Every time I do something wrong and my mom gets upset or if I get a bad score, I go into endless spiral of anxiety which always ends with me begging my mom not to kill herself, I am sorry I will do my best please dont leave me 

And hyperventilating, crying (which happens so suddenly)

I genuinely don't have what to do

If I tell someone, they will report my parents and that idea petrifies me since I believe that she will try to end herself again. (I know she won't but I can't help it.)

Let me explain what this “best friend” of 2/half years was treating me like. She started being rude to me and i know that she has a fat ego I’ve told her about and I told her that it doesn’t make me feel good when she puts me and the friend group down to lift her self up. When I said things or tried to talk about things that meant something to me she’d put the conversation on herself again. She’d brag about the same shit every day. I felt like I was dumb and useless and that I always told myself she was smarter than me. And she would tell me about all her exes and how they still like her and stuff…especially when a new guy came to school she claimed that he was her ex..which is a lie..he’s never even been to our town and dude was a whole 19 year old. ANYWAY fat ego like i said but her treatment towards me got to me really bad it started causing me pain it got so bad to the point were I started to get into these really dark places mentally and I just felt like shit. And I just could not fucking do it anymore so cut her off. Buttt this comes with some uh idk how to say it. But my nephew went into some depression over the whole thing he didn’t want our group to split. But I just said drop me too, to cause him less stress of trying to be friends with the both of us. But now since then I’ve been kindof distancing myself from everyone and he’s been hanging with her at lunch in school while I’m up in the library. (I have no classes with him I only get to see him at lunch or in passing periods) And i told him I didn’t care that he talks or hangs with her. But I have to admit it hurts me. even the three of us complained about her together and she treated us all like shit. But I tried to be a reallly good friend yknow like I was there when they needed to vent or cry I gave advice on there life stuff. and now that he hangs with her at lunch then still tries to talk to me but protect her at the same time is insane to me. so now I just dont wanna talk to him either.

Is the mind really this powerful?,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
Hi everyone,I'm a 24 year old man who lost his dad to cancer in 2013. Not to bore you with the whole story: I've been having OCD and anxiety since I were a little kid. After a traumatic experience that started on April 28th, 2022, I was sure cancer was going to kill me. I felt an immovable hard lump above my collarbone on the right side of my body. An echo showed nothing malignant, but on the 9th of May 2022 I started having a weird pressure on the right side of my head accompanied by a left side weakness of my left leg and left arm.

Went to my GP and she brushed it off as anxiety, because I passed the balance,reflex tests etc. and the weakness wasn't measurable. However, I continued having these symptoms every day 24/7 until today. Went to my GP last week and again she told me: the fact that these symptoms didn't worsen can tell you it's nothing sinister. Even told her I had this weird smell sensations that would come and go since April/May of 2023. Since that visit I fell hard, really hard. I've done a lot of research and I sought a lot of reassurance, but based on my symptoms I can't imagine it being psychosomatic or something. Even with my intense trauma's in the last 10 years. I always thought it would be something that's in my mind since it started after reading about cancer in that stressful period. Last year the symptoms just went more to the background as i didn't give it much attention, but now that my anxiety is high again I can only think about this. My left leg and arm twitches here and there and sometimes i feel spasms when almost falling asleep on that side too. These are all red flags.How is this possible, can I be having a brain tumour for the past 2 years and no one taking me serious? I'm terrified really, what if it was a low grade tumour in 2022 and it's turned malignant now. What if this thing is really inside my brain and is spreading. I have a beautiful fiancee whom I will marry in July and we bought a house that's almost ready. Will I really not be able to see those beautiful things happen? It may sound dramatic, so I'm sorry but for me this feels terrifying and how can all these symptoms be explained in any other way?

I want to ask for a neuro appointment and at the same time I'm terrified to do that. Terrified to have him tell me I have something real bad. At this moment I just don't know what to do and how to handle this. I am even linking my OCD and Anxiety that started 10 years back to something that had already started to grow in my temporal lobe (where I feel the pressure).

My mom, fiancee, sister.. they all have been telling me to trust the doctors and that I should see a therapist instead of a neurologist. What if they're wrong, what if I have something.. How would they feel about this. I don't want to hurt them, I just want to enjoy my life and I'm afraid it will end soon.PS: I never vomited because of the head pressure. It also never wakes me up from sleep and isn't worse in the morning. Constant 3-4/10 pressure that can get worse when exercising or bending over. Always returns normal after standing back up again. Also my right eye twitches the last couple of weeks when i close my eyelids.",False,False,Anxiety,661126,Hot,2024,2,Very low,0,33,3185,positive,negative,False,False,0,0,0

I wasn’t very comfortable, but when I asked to do something else, she would say ""oh just a little bit more, 5 more minutes"", again and again. One day, she asked if I wanted to try the stuff she had shown me. Ofc I refused, because wtf
She asked me alot and alot of times. I think she asked 2-3 times everytime I saw her for like, 6 months. (We saw each other everyday). So once I said okay again. I didn’t want her to be mad at me if I declined, and I wanted to stay her friend. We still kept our underwear because I asked her to and she agreed. I hated it. I won’t tell you details about this part but yeah. 
She was getting weird. We watched titanic and she was masturbating next to me. She then asked me ""I found mom’s plastic p*nis, do you want me to go get it?"" I was so uncomfortable that I literally just said ""no"" and ran away. I never told my mom to this day, but I told my best friends.

My father constantly claims that the communist times in Eastern Europe were better. I developed mental health issues as a result of my trauma related to severe bullying from the past and partially because I constantly had to try to become the person that my dad wants me to be instead of who I really am. He wanted me to be in the military but when I developed mental health issues and realized that wanted to become a psychologist instead of a soldier, I successfully submitted in a voluntary release. My dad however kept trying to convince me to stay in the military and was gaslighting me about my mental health issues and suicidal ideation and was even mocking me for them. He said stuff like ""You are hiding behind your ""mental health issues"""" and ""I don't believe you have suicidal thoughts. If you did have suicidal thoughts, why didn't you attempt?"". When I was hospitalized for my suicidal contemplation for a while, he even video called me to threaten to disown me as his daughter if I don't ""apologize"" to my military chain of command for my ""lapse in judgement"" (he was referring to my mental health issues and suicidal ideation). There were also times in which he threatened to disown me if I don't stay in the military and follow HIS dreams. 

My dad claimed that the belief system back in communist Eastern Europe was better because apparently, less people got mental health issues.....despite all the stigma surrounding it. Back then, it was acceptable for parents to control their adult children's futures and force them on career paths that are against their children's wishes. My cousin told me that how my dad dealt with my mental health issues would have been seen as ""normal"" and ""acceptable"" in communist Eastern Europe. Back then, people going through trauma are forced to just ""suck it up.""

What baffles me though is that it at least appears that there was hardly any cases of mental health issues and trauma during the times of Communism in Eastern Europe compared to modern day North America despite more stigma and shame related to mental health issues as well as the normalization of abusive parenting back then. Is it only because cases of mental health issues were not reported back then...that families hid it well ....that mental health issues manifest differently in people who suppress them?

My poor grades have been such a burden to me.,2,False,False,True,False,5,False,"I was always a 'smart kid' if you could say. I was kind of rebellious but I was told what to do by my parents academically. I attended KUMON (I know not the most optimal, but it wasn't too bad) every Tuesday, and did comprehension and math exceeded from my current school level.

Got A's and B's on my report cards, my teachers told my parents that I was usually well-behaved, focus on my work, had a great personality and was exceeding in my academics. During that I loved myself, I was very proud of myself. I was negligent of all the world's problems, like a typical child.

But from 5th - 6th grade, it was like a goddamn downward spiral. I suddenly neglected self care, skipped showering, brushing my teeth, had shitty sleep schedule, and multiple other destructive habits I wish I hadn't engaged. I was more shy, and was deeply self-loathing. And so my studying concentration and schedule were affected extremely.

Last Christmas, I am now in 7th grade. Academics got more tiring and more difficult to handle. During primary school, I would be helped by my mother for the tests, and/or studied independently. Now I was entirely studying by myself, and from my hand-written notes. And guess what, I was a lazy slut. I secretly played video games all day rather than studying, still neglected self-care, and I f\*cking hated that, I hated all of that, I wish I could go back, but the damage was done.

I got A's, but now with C's and D's. My parents were extremely upset and also shocked, and we had such a massive argument, and all of my self-esteem was destroyed, and my mother compared me to a succesful and happy person, and also said that 'at least he loved his mother and father'.

I was emotionally scarred by that. Although the yelling I thought was pretty unnecessarily overreacted, they were right. I had failed on the only thing I excelled at. I was a burden. I depicted myself as a failure. As a younger kid, I knew I was always good at my school, and so I worked hard to impress others on multiple skills, now I couldn't even keep up with my grades. I was really a failure.

December to February, I deeply self-loathed myself, I was confused. I was such a 'bright' kid, I was a kid to happily talk to, a funny and dignified kid, a kid to have fun. And now I still have a bunch of self-destructive behaviours, and I still didn't practise any self-care. All those problems just made my self-hatred worse. I now needed additional tutors and extra studying everyday (I thought it was pretty unusual and pretty extreme for such mediocre grades), but I couldn't concentrate in those as well, as my self-loathing problem was still heavily affecting my studying, probably even worse. And to top it off, I hated that I was so mentally immature.

I don't know, I just felt like such a burden to my parents, to my siblings. To my uncles, and to my cousins. To everyone I tried to impress, I was a joke. I nitpicked every tiny and to the most deep gut-wrenching memories, and focused on all the bad things I have done.

It still can't get better. I tried to practise more healthy habits, but they were either too ineffective, or were broken early to even be regulated. I feel like I am wasting every second of my life, every second I did waste of my life. I don't want this to continue to college, that is like a time-bomb waiting to explode.

I’m an incel 19M,0,False,False,True,False,2,False,"













I’ve recently come to terms with the fact I’m an incel 
For some background info I’m 6”2 blonde, 19 (20 in may) athletic build I finished school in may and now I’m working in fast food, I have some half decent qualifications and I’m looking for better jobs. 
I’m terms of my love life, I’m a Virgin and I’ve never been in a relationship. The most I’ve ever done with a girl is just classic making out, but nothing beyond that. People often tell me I’m good looking and are shocked when I tell them I’m a Virgin. I make out as though I’m a Virgin by choice but I’m really not. I’m obsessed with sex and I think about it all the time. I’ve never had a one night stand because the opportunity has never presented itself. I don’t really go clubbing a lot or anything. I didn’t masturbate till I was 18 also. Why? I still don’t know. I thought the idea of tugging ur dick was so weird so I would wet dream instead. Now ever since I started I masturbate 3/4 times per day. I don’t watch porn however just wank to girls in bikinis/ lingerie. 

During my school years I was quite popular due to the fact I had a class clown rep and I was a good sportsman, but only amongst blokes. I didn’t know how to talk to girls at all. 
I would always go for the best and most popular girls, and it would never work out, At parties and stuff I would often indulge myself with alcohol and then it gave me a drinking problem at 16. When drunk I would make a lot of inappropriate verbal advances towards girls making some extremely uncomfortable. This was not my intention but it how it came across. I thought I was flirting. I wouldn’t SA and force myself cos I don’t have that in me even when blackout drunk. Some of them were very upset with what I said to them. I apologised and they forgave me. I have since stopped drinking. I have been sober since my 18th birthday. But I can’t forgive myself for this behaviour. 

- [ ] Every girl I’ve ever had a crush on has rejected me and it led me to extreme hatred for them and their eventual boyfriends. I would often go for 9 or 10/10 girls and it would never work out. I just wanted to be with the most beautiful women.. I was very awkward up until about a year ago when I started talking to this girl. She was about 6/10 looks but 10/10 personality. We instantly connected and I met up with her a lot and we had something going. She then asked if we wanted a relationship, I was unsure if I wanted a relationship or just sex. I told her I wasn’t ready yet and I would constantly ask her to come back to mine, she was very unsure but when she realised that I just wanted sex she got angry at me. I apologised and she forgave me and we carried on talking for a bit but eventually it faded. 
- [ ] I then spoke to her again for the first time in 10 months yesterday and we were talking again and I apologised, but it wasn’t the same, Eventuslly she just aired my messages and that was that. I really fucked up something that could have been great because in my head I thought I could do better. She was the only girl that’s ever showed full interest in me and I fucked it up bad. She has lost her interest and to be fair I don’t blame her, I was too busy chasing the wrong girls instead of her and I came crawling back and she fucked me off. I’ve never experienced anything like I had with this girl cos I was too busy chasing the wrong girls. 
- [ ] I’ve now come to this conclusion that I have a hatred for women. Why? Because they are entitled and they have It so easy. You can be a 4/10 women in the modern and and go to the club and get attention. If you’re a 4/10 woman u instantly have access to 95% of men. U don’t have to put any effort in, you don’t have to have a personality, you don’t have to go out and work on yourself, you just are who u are. If a man works in McDonald’s, they’re mocked by society, if a woman does they’re seen as hard working and independent. I know extremely shallow, ugly boring nasty women that can still go to the club and get attention. Whilst I as a man try and approach a girl I get laughed at and told to fuck off. You don’t need to be shit and girls act as though the world owes them everything when they don’t give the world shit in most cases 
- [ ] I think society has fully failed men. Why do u think 81% of suicides in the west are men? I think if most women lived a day as man they’d break down and cry over how hard it is. I don’t think many of them realise it. To have any chance with a girl these days u have to be of a certain status 
- [ ] I’ve been driven to suicidal and homicidal thoughts. I idolise Patrick Bateman cos of my hatred for the world and I’ve started to love Jeffrey dahmer also. I know this is and but I’m just so angry. I just want to feel loved by someone and I feel I’ve wasted my teenage years and youth dossing about. 
- [ ] So there’s my sob story. I’m probably a whiny bitch but that’s how I feel. God bless

Please help me,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi,

24M

Please read the full story, I need to vent and I need some advice.

Been having health anxiety since my dad passed away in 2013. I didn’t process his loss at that time and recused to feel anything. He left us with some debts and we don’t have a family besides my mom, me and my sister. I started working when I was 14 to help pay the debts and I was in a constant mode of survival. Developed a cough that lasted 3 years and dissapeared suddenly, also developed IBS symptoms 5 years ago (always loose and sticky stools and weekly discomfort in my stomach) that my GP says are because of stress.

Had a girlfriend from 2013 to 2018 that treated me like garbage, cheated on me and left me. After the breakup is when the cough and colon issues started. Got in big financial problems that caused me to feel really depressed. Met my wonderful fianceé that helped me get through that. 

Since 2 years i have some left arm and leg weakness accompanied by a right sided head pressure that fluctuates in severity but has almost always been a 2-3/10. It sometimes gets worse with exercise or bending over. All these symptoms are there 24/7. 2 years ago i passed the neuro tests with my GP (reflexes, balance etc.) she couldn’t measure the weakness but i feel it’s there. Last tuesday she did those tests again and the results were remarkable again. For example: i do kickboxing and i can kick and hook hard with my left side, but it seems a little weaker. When I walk up the stairs i also notice it and when I lean on my left leg or left arm it starts shaking more than the right side and feels more tired. This didn’t get worse in the course of 2 years. The head pressure doesn’t wake me up from sleep, isn’t worse in the morning and never made me vomit. Also my right eye twitches when I close it hard.

Since a year I also have an occasional weird smell/taste that is often triggered by sneezing or breathing in hard through my nose. It’s like when I breathe in hard something chemical “unlocks” in my nose and things smell weird. Fragrances and coffee can smell really bad where for example a banana keeps smelling like a banana. After sleeping it resets itself again. I had covid in august 2022, got my smell back and some months later this came on, maybe it’s because of that I don’t know. 

My google skills showed me the worst: a tumor in my right temporal lobe which causes weird smell sensations and left sided weakness. I am terrified. I convinced myself it can’t be anything else. Everyone around me says to trust the docs. I’m afraid that it was a benign tumor or a low grade tumor 2 years ago and that i’ve waited too long. GP said these symptoms would’ve progressed in 2 years and would be pretty prominent if it were a brain tumor but I also read stories of people not having symptoms at all and suddenly they have a grade 4 brain tumour. 

Im only 24 and I don’t see a future ahead of me. I’m gonna get married in July and we just bought a house that’s ready in May and i’m so scared of not making it. I have extreme anxiety during the night and can’t sleep properly the last couple of days. I’m waiting to get therapy.

Anyone with knowledge about this? What type of brain tumour could cause these longlasting symptoms that stay the same? A benign one I hope? Maybe a low grade one? Or are these symptoms not at all concerning because they didn’t develop?

My mom says to see a therapist and not a neurologist, because she doesn’t believe this is a tumor. She worked as an nurse-assistant at the neuro department in a hospital and told me people look way worse, but i know there are exceptions and i can be one of them.. can this really all be psychosomatic?

Everyone is telling me not to go to the neurologist and not feed the anxiety monster and trust my GP and her neuro-exam (reflexes, balance etc.) It’s so difficult for me to believe that this is all psychosomatic. Is that really possible? What if i had a low grade tumor that now is high grade and will kill me soon. Afraid of having a seizure suddenly in my sleep and waking up to terrible news in a hospital. Can these prolonged sustained combination of symptoms be psychosomatic? I also have OCD since I were a kid and recurrent episodes of depersonalization and I’ve read that this can also be because of a temporal lobe tumor.. At one minute I cry a lot because i think it’s over for me and the next minute i can have some hope that it’s all gonna be ok, is this worrisome to have (mood swings)?

My teacher ruined my life,6,False,False,True,False,6,False,"She was a 50-year-old teacher. We are both females. She led me on to think she liked me. Through her interactions with me, she made me think she liked me by giving me compliments, saying she liked my hair, my shoes, smiling at me, noticing I grew taller, bragging about dancing with me, asking me where I was when I didn't take her class, telling my mom at a conference that I was a ""very fine young lady."" I thought she was a lesbian and was in love with me. She was divorced and had kids.

I fell in love with her. When I continually saw her, my feelings grew. She occupied every space in my mind. I built this fantasy about her in my head and convinced myself that she loved me. I replayed different scenarios in my head, my interactions with her in person and my fantasies. She pulled me off from my course and I wasn't able to do a lot of things, like having friends in high school, going out, doing activities, volunteering. Because all I wanted was to think about her. Even during the summers, I was wondering how I was going to survive without her for 3 months. I even purposefully took a class for two summers because all I wanted was to see her. And the summers when I didn't class, all I did was think about her.

I missed out on many opportunities like dating and been in real relationships. I yearned for her. I remember all of the things she said that were so momentary and minor that she long forgotten. I invested a lot in her. I turned down offers from guys to remain faithful to her. I have never been in a relationship, had sex, or been kissed to remain faithful to her. And for the rest of my life, it will remain this way.

My life revolved around her to the point where all I did was think about her, and I got jealous when she interacted with people, like students, right in front me. I got jealous when she talked about people in her life, like her kids and other students in a positive way. I couldn't handle it. I wanted her all to myself. I had these high expectations of her and I wanted to her to praise me every time she saw me. And when she stopped doing that, I became disappointed and depressed.

I asked my classmates and they said, ""No, she doesn't like you in that way. It's just all in your head. You have to believe me because I am telling you the truth.""

""She doesn't love you. You told me you think about her a lot, do you think she thinks about you? You are going to get hurt, and she is going to take you to hell with her. Is that what you want?""

And even then I didn't listen because I didn't want to. And to hell she took me. I ended up telling her I liked her, and she rejected me. I even broke down to the point where I was sent to a mental institution because of her. That was her fault. And from that point on, nothing was ever the same in my life. She ignored me as if I were dead since I told her I liked her. She ruined every aspect of my life. She ruined my grades. They used to be so high before all that happened. I let myself go, appearance wise. I became fat and gotten pimples. I became less pretty. My relationship with my mother became worse. She made me depressed. I wasted my life before her and cried over her almost every day for many years.

I felt like I was helpless so I never disobeyed them because of not the respect I fucking had for them it was the fear they instilled in me. When I entered high school, I sat next to someone, we shared our problems we had in common. At one point of my life, I was yelled at by someone, at first, I didn't react, but after a few minutes, my heart and mind broke down, I started to curse. That was the start, the real trigger. On the same day, I got yelled the second time but it was my fault. I then ran into the corner, I had to slap myself to keep me calm because the other side was overpowering my brain. I have low self-esteem. When people ignore me, I tend to be mad or sad. I know, I admit I am an attention seeker. I went to my school counselor, I told her about this but all she did was tell me it never happened, she didn't tell me to go to a psychiatrist, she told me I think too much. I come from an asian community so basically if you have fucking depression, they'll just fucking tell you off or worse they'll call you stupid and make it more worse. Yeah, she told me that school counselors are more on which universities are you going to but at least help persuade my parents to allow me to see a psychiatrist. Friends aren't much help either, when they tell me their problems, I listen, well I tell my problems, they don't take it to seriously but I was stupid because I told them I had a lot of other problems which turned out I didn't have a long time ago but this problem, disorder was serious, when I heard about this disorder, more detailed, C-PTSD, I didn't quite take it seriously after deep research, I had to conclude I had PTSD. I NEVER WANTED TO  HAVE IT, AND EVEN HOPE FOR IT TO GO AWAY BUT IT COMES BACK AND HAUNTS ME. I REALLY NEED TO GO TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

I feel I'd just keep going from here to there and eventually end up doing nothing as I don't know what I want to do in life. I'm just an aimless guy who sucks at everything. ** 

Ik its a long post. I'd be happy if anyone can talk about it with me.

..I'm 21. Graduating in July. Bachelors in CS.

..Had plans to pursue masters next year. Cancelled now.

..I never explored any tech. to the deep as I wanted to know a bit about everything as I was merely exploring as to what I'd wanna pursue.

..Didn't sit for placements, as I was quite sure that I'd be doing an internship post graduation and then I'd apply for masters. Hence, didn't practice coding/apti.

..So now I don't a have job. I certainly lack good coding skills, I suck at maths so my Aptitude skills are not good too.

..My project is in the field of IoT with minimal application of IoT although it involves a lot of sensors & the results prove my project to be significant. But basically it isn't even a software and I have no clue if any employer in IT sector would even pay heed to that project.

..I'm lost. I don't know what field to explore or what should I do now, what should I learn, how will I get a job etc etc.

..I didn't do really cool software projects during undergrad, Although did okayish software+hardware projects. I have 2-3 of them to show in my CV.",False,False,AnxietyDepression,55681,Controversial,2020,5,Very high,0,37,1896,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

If you were traumatized by something to the point where your brain suffers, I don’t see how that would count as a disorder because it usually can go away with treatment.

5 Things I’m Doing to Improve my Mental Health,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"The mental health topic is not so common in our society and it is one of the things that many people shy away from.

But either we admit it or not, many of us struggle with it and it’s not a disease.

The same way I will take care of myself when dealing with malaria or any other form of illness is the same way I should take care of my mental health too.

The Importance of Self-Talk For Success In Anything,1,False,False,True,False,0,False," 

One of the most important parts of being happy and successful is the way you talk to yourself. Self-talk is often a predictor of your actions. If your self-talk is negative and you tell yourself that you are never going to make it, chances are that you aren't going to make it. Tell yourself that you have this and that you can make it, and you'll probably make it. Optimistic self-talk is a huge advantage over pessimistic self-talk. Realize this and tell yourself, ""I got this.""

Mental Hospitals are internment camps for neurodivergent people.,11,False,False,True,False,8,False,"It's disgusting that society puts people in those things. It is a clear violations of the principles of civil rights and the America ideal that all humans are created equal.  

The idea of mental hospitals are based on the idea that neurodivergent people do not have the same rights as neurotypical people. Often locking them up without trial and *without consent*. 

Within these facilities people are deprived of basic things, including privacy. Not even neurotypical prisoners are treated this way. Restraint (a form of physical assault) is used. Mind altering drugs are administered without consent, not for the sake of helping the people they're being used on but for the ease of the people around them, or to try to make them neurotypical (sadly, this is how these drugs are often used on the outside as well).

Everyone I know who has been to one of these describes it as torture, I have even had a friend say jail is preferable, and I believe him (though I don't think jails should exist either). These are not conditions ever acceptable to put neurotypical people in. 

It should also be mentioned that every afab person I know whose been to a mental hospital has been assaulted, and would have been punished for mentioning it while trapped with them. People are also segragated based on sex and not gender, which is seriously dangurous for some people.

I know a lot of people where I live (New York) blame Regan (a historical figure I first started researching because of a lemon demon song) for closing down mental hospitals and causing homelessness to rise. But I prefer sharing my city with homeless people then having more people subjected to abuse.
