So in 2022 I developed something called ""fear of not falling asleep"". In the middle of the day I would  tpanic before bedtime because I was afraid my neighbour would have music loud and on which distrurbrd my sleep.

I used to work for a fast food company and we could have schedules like starting at 5am in the morning and next day 5pm in the afternoon.

That neighbour used to have loud music when I want to sleep. I started to get anxious before bedtime and developed the fear. 
I would have panic attacks, stomach cramps.

I started therapy months ago and the therapist said it as all caused by anxiety. 
Now I am waiting to ha CBT.

I was on mirtazapine since Dec 2022 and stopped taking on week ago. Mirtazapine ""erased"" the fear.
Mirtazapine has nasty effects and I don't want it anymore.

Then one of my family member find her death and I did not felt sorry or anything, I think my mother and grandmother suspected since this moment that I had something and still I never went to a therapist.

A few years ago I thought about suicide but I also hate people that choose the easiest option, I know it's strange.

In my life I also thought of hurting others, only the one that were not nice with me (I was never bullied if it's relevant).

I difficultly make contact with others, and I hate a lot of things and people, the ""friends"" that I have now.. next year when I'll be done with high school I'll never see them again I think.

One time I had a girlfriend and I loved her but she left, I really tried everything to not her go away, but now I understand she didn't loved me anymore, but I learned somethings about me.
Like if she said to me like to get a new haircut that she liked but not me I would listen to her, but if I told her about a haircut for there she felt like she needed to do it, if she would say no I would be irritated but I wouldn't anything more (I never hurted anyone).

When I see gore video's of people that commit suicide or die I just don't feel nothing, and I'm a true crime lover, I listen to podcast about all the crime, I understand very well that it's bad and everything, but I feel nothing.

So I'm 19, I had a nasty 2 years between 16 and 18, I can barely remember a full week from then, I was a fucking wrecking ball of emotion and mental breakdowns.

I started exercising properly [thanks r/fitness], working harder and becoming popular - everything looked up for me.

Not going to divulge too much more for anonymity's sake, but recently with the oncoming Winter, things started to get wobbly - after near 18 months of being relatively great.

Came home today, got a bollocking from my dad for lying about not having school one day [was feeling particularly bad, skipped 2 lessons].

I felt like crying, I was angry at myself, felt weak, pitied myself but hated too. Angry at him for not understand.

----

I suddenly realised I should do it, so I walked into his office, asked to chat and we talked for 3 minutes about it, I said ""I know I'm not the clearest when it comes to emotion, but I haven't been feeling too great, I'm sorry about school but I wanted you to know I've been slowing down for the past week or two"".

It was easy, didn't go into much detail and got the general message across. As I walked out of that office it was like a demon was exorcised from me, a weight was lifted from my chest.

So my parents’ idea of an intervention is sitting me down and listing off the reasons I’m disappointing them and basically not listening to what I’m struggling with,185,False,False,True,False,25,False,"So I’m quite a mess. Hah. Quarantine hasn’t helped. The idea of writing an email freaks me out. Everything freaks me out. And when I bring up the possibility of me actually having anxiety or being depressed my mom says I have to “train my brain” and that only I can fix what’s wrong.

I’m really a mess. I do nothing all day because the idea of doing something makes me restless and terrified.  But my mother doesn’t buy that and says that I’m just lazy. And I’m starting to believe her. I’m making excuses maybe? For not having to put in work?

I basically hate myself now hahaha. My parents sat me down and threw allllll the reasons why I suck at me and that I’m not living up to my true potential. Jesus I can’t even really write this properly because I’m still so shook. They shook me. I had created this fake me that would eventually figure herself out. My parents shattered that and now I basically feel worthless.

I want to be a doctor. HAHAHAHA right? My dad was all “you can’t be a doctor the way you’re going. You have no responsibility. No drive. No motivation.”

Like they were literally sitting there. Conversing with each other about why I was being a disappointment. While I was present. It felt so toxic and I couldn’t figure out if I deserved it or not. They talked about how I wasted 4 months of being stuck at home and did nothing productive. How I can’t even make my bed consistently. Now, I know I don’t know shit but I thought interventions were supposed to help. Not make me feel like actual. Human. Trash. 

So idk if I’m depressed. I certainly feel so. I feel tired all the time. Small tasks seem like someone asking me to climb fucking Mount Everest. But my mother (who’s an ADULT who deserves RESPECT who has wiSdOm) said that I’m perfectly fine. I just have to stop being dramatic, snap out of it and just do my work.

I’m a senior in high school. Which means applications. And essays and SATs and a whole bunch of crap that makes me weak just thinking about. I’m scared of everything. I love medicine. I want to be a frickin surgeon lmaoooo but I’m wondering how the hell I’m gonna get anywhere if literally writing an email to my counselor scares the hell out of me. 

I’m just— I don’t know. I’m hurting. I was okay for a solid week! At least I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t doing much homework but at least I didn’t feel like I was in despair. And then... and then my parents decided to explain how I’m not okay and how I’m doing everything horribly wrong. 

I want to be successful. I want to be motivated and ambitious. But talking to people scares me. And big things like applying to college scares me. I’m scared. And the best advice my mom can give me is to simply NOT be scared.

Nurse with social anxiety ,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"My whole life I’ve had really bad social anxiety and when I was little my anxiety was so bad that I had selective mutism. I have always struggled with talking to people and all throughout elementary, middle, and high school I was known as the quiet girl and people would always ask me why I didn’t talk or why I was so quiet. Then in 10th or 11th grade I finally went on Zoloft and it honestly changed my life. Although I still have anxiety and will always have some level of social anxiety and generalized anxiety, being on Zoloft has made it way more bearable. Instead of giving one word answers when people try and talk to me, I am able to force myself to say more and somewhat keep the conversation going. I have been on 200 mg of Zoloft for a really long time now and I can’t imagine going off it. I tried to wean myself off it recently to see how I would do without it and once I was on 150 mg for a month, I could feel my anxiety getting worse so I went back to 200 mg. 

That’s just a little backstory but why I really wanted to make this post is because I am currently so nervous. I just recently graduated college and got a degree in nursing. I still am not sure why I chose a profession where I have to be social all the time and I am so worried that I won’t seem confident enough and my coworkers and patients will think I’m stupid. Even though Zoloft has made my social anxiety far better than it used to be, I still have it and although I can fake conversations better now, I am still bad at it. I am going to be an oncology nurse and I’m so worried about having to comfort patients because I am very bad at comforting people and never know what to say. I’m also really worried because I can be a pretty sensitive person when people are rude to me for no reason and sadly that seems to be a common occurrence with nursing. Nurses can be so mean to each other and I’m worried I’ll get bullied for being so dumb and not confident. My job starts in 4 days and I keep mentally preparing myself for bullying. I feel like the more I expect it to happen, I won't be as surprised when it happens and I won't cry. This is definitely a worst case scenario but I just want to be prepared and hopefully I will be able to have the courage to stand up for myself. Is anyone else here a nurse with social anxiety?

10 useful mental models that will make you a better decision-maker,87,False,False,True,False,25,False,"Life is a decision-making game.

Career choices, investments, marriage...

The decisions you make define your results, for better or worse.

So becoming a better decision-maker is like knowing the cheat codes of life. 

And here are 10 useful mental models to become a better decision-maker:

# 1- Inverse Thinking  

When options are broad, making the right decision is hard.  

But inversion can take you closer to the best path.  

So instead of: “What should I do to be happy?”   

Ask: “What would make my life miserable?"" And avoid them.

#  2- Via Negativa  

Nassim Taleb describes it as ""*solution through subtraction*.”  

Instead of adding more to a system or your life; look for things to **cut**.

Want to improve your health?  

Don’t buy supplements. Cut smoking, sugar, and drinking first. 

Project is failing?

Don't put in more resources. Cut what's not working and refocus existing resources on the core target.  


https://preview.redd.it/8uwmeunmq5v91.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb451d0d3897046392183cd5a05f727b74d3a571

# 3- Second-Order Thinking  

Every decision has consequences.   

But consequences also have consequences.  

So before big decisions, assess what can happen after the obvious results (in 10 days, 10 months & 10 years).

A seemingly *easy* decision can have adverse second-order effects.  


https://preview.redd.it/jc1eu2joq5v91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c2a7faace22a3bacd22546d25a975e9338a615a

#  4- The Framing Effect  

People react differently to the same decision depending on different frames.  

10% death risk from surgery sounds scary. But a 90% success rate sounds safe.  

So always take your decision through the **negative frame** to assess the real risk.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/fj5cuufyq5v91.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28f283ed30a2ffbe0e7e2c299ad3bd27cba3b29d

#  5- A-B-Z Framework  

Having a long-term goal is good.  

But it's overwhelming when you think about how to get there.  

To make things easier: 

Assess where you are (A)  
Set your direction (Z)  
Decide on your immediate next step (B). Take that action.  

It's a useful method to avoid **analysis paralysis**.  


H/T Shaan Puri

https://preview.redd.it/xtd9avczq5v91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4d3083bea4be2ac71ce825a3de3f38472560b9d

#  6- Sunk Cost Fallacy  

The **past cost** influences people’s decisions.  

But how much you invested in a stock doesn’t matter if the company is failing.  

So avoid the influence of sunk cost in today’s decisions — whether it’s time, effort, or money. 

# 7- Personal SWOT Analysis   

Executives use SWOT to have situational awareness of their companies.  

It stands for:   

\- Strengths   
\- Weaknesses   
\- Opportunities   
\- Threats

#  8- Type 1 vs. Type 2 Decisions  

A framework from Jeff Bezos.  

Divide your decisions into two to avoid analysis paralysis:  

**Type 1 (irreversible):** Carefully assess the consequences. Take your time.  

**Type 2 (reversible):** Make the decision as soon as possible. No need to waste time as you can always go back.

#  9- Steel-manning  

Strengthen an opposing argument to understand it better.

So you can change your opinion (when needed) to make the right decisions.

#  10- Regret Minimization Framework  

Another one from Bezos.   

Before founding Amazon he projected himself as 80 years old.  

Would his old self regret not joining the internet wave?  

After this framing, the decision was easy.  So minimize your regrets with this simple question.

**P.S.** I've written about some of these mental models in this sub before. 

But I realized people enjoy short descriptions in list format more than deep-dive articles. So I'm categorizing them for different purposes (decision-making, productivity, persuasion, etc.) and continue making lists here.

How do I express myself,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi this is my first ever post, I’m 19M I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for a year and a half. I made a mistake at the beginning of our relationship and got nudes from another girl. I tried to put it past me but she found out after a year of us together. Ik that I have no room to complain but I feel like she just doesn’t care about me anymore, I feel like I have to work hard to get her trust back and win her love again. Because of this I don’t go with her to my insecurities because she thinks I’m projecting and she thinks that I’m doing something wrong. Ig it’d be good to mention we are doing long distance right now and it makes it so much more tough. I tried to talk to her tonight about how I felt I told her that I feel like she’s been distant and that combined with her partying with her friends every weekend was causing me to spiral. She told me that she doesn’t understand why my problem has to be hers, this hurt and I tried to explain that Ik I’m overthinking and i trust she would never do anything but I’m just insecure. She took a while to respond so I went on tik tok I saw she was active and that hurt so much. I called her out and she didn’t see anything wrong with it she said she was waiting for me to respond and decided to go on tik tok. Some may agree with her that there was no malice behind it but it made me feel like the conversation wasn’t important to her. Even now she’s telling me that by talking about my insecurities it’s taking away from the postive attention I give her and that she wants me to keep the spark alive by making her feel special. LIKE I LITERALLY JUST WROTE MY FINAL ABOUT HOW MUCH LOVE I HAVE FOR HER. I don’t want to go to anyone else cause they don’t know her like I do and everything I’ve written probably paints her in a negative image but I’m so tired of not being comfortable when I’m struggling and it turning back on me for being insecure.

Should I tell my therapist about this?,9,False,False,True,False,5,False,"I (20M) have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration, so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later, or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression.

"This may strike a nerve with some folks in here, but here goes...",3,False,False,True,False,5,False,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety on and off for about 15 years (ever since I said goodbye to the more serious drugs). I’ve never really been medicated, even though I was diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety in the past.

Recently I’ve come to a realization that some may benefit from, while others may be angered by.

I firmly believe that 90% of depression and anxiety is caused by something in your life that you know you should be taking care of, but aren’t mustering up the effort to handle. It’s your brain and/or souls way of punishing you.

Maybe it’s an unpaid bill.
Maybe it’s a family relationship you know you should mend, but haven’t.
Maybe you didn’t do your taxes in 2008 and you’re still wondering in the back of your head if it’ll ever come back to bite you in the arse.
Maybe you’ve done something wrong and haven’t told anyone, and you subconsciously feel guilty. 
Maybe you have certain habits that you know you need to break, but it’s your lifestyle... or whatever other excuse you come with.

My point... maybe if you just got up every morning, did the things you know you need to do, handled the business you needed to handle, and cherished the relationships you have (including your relationship with yourself)... you just might feel a million times better.

I know for a fact that when I complete a task which I know I’ve been procrastinating, the sense of accomplishment I feel when I’m finished is equal to or greater than any medication out there.

Now, I’m not trying to stand on a pedestal here. I continue to have great difficulty implementing this in my own life each and every day. This message is as much to myself as it is to all of you.

What’s a good alternative to therapy for someone who can’t afford it?,3,False,False,True,False,8,False,"
Hey, everyone, UC here. I’ve known for a long time there’s something desperately wrong with me, probably fundamentally broken (which sucks to accept but eh fuck it I have to or I’ll never do anything about it). The problem comes with the fact I don’t know what I can do about it. For most people on here, the answer is to go to a therapist and get support, which is definitely the Good Ending. 

Unfortunately, I have a lot of barriers in the way that are stopping me. In no particular order:

1. I go to medical school in another state than my home state, so I don’t have my PCP down here and I can’t just book an emergency appointment with him while away for 2.5 months at a time (and only home for a week each break). Plus that also means I can’t get any sort of diagnosis from him for whatever is wrong or any prescriptions (much less let insurance take care of the costs which I’ll elaborate on below)

2. The insurance I get through my parents is comprehensive, but the itemized billing they get would tell them that I’m getting therapy, which is absolutely NOT ACCEPTABLE. If they know, I could get my funds cut off in the middle of semester and I can’t get more loans until the next cycle (meaning what I have is what I get for the next few months). On the other hand, the insurance I get through my school has such a high deductible and copay

3. According to my school, they treat us as if we’re living in the “real world” and the real world doesn’t do “free”, so they don’t offer mental health resources outside of a mindfulness app, which is cool and all except very impersonal and I feel like I’d need a personal touch.

4. The way that my school’s former Dean treated one student who had depression and had to be hospitalized scares me into not wanting to even RISK being involuntarily confined. Suffice it to say, he came to her hospital room to tell her if she couldn’t get a hold of herself then she isn’t cut out to be a doctor.

but avoiding everyone surely doesnt make that weight go away? but if people expect me to avoid and ignore then i guess it means they get used to it. which is good. but also not. they can be used to it and enjoy my company whenever i show up again and when i leave itll be like nothings changed. i wonder if it would stay that way if i wasnt around anymore. would it change? would anything change? would my same old social routine where i ignore and avoid anyone and everyone that cares about me feel much different? maybe theyll just think im gone for a few more weeks or months and then i’ll come back, so they wont think twice when i leave.

My brother's basically a dead man walking,9,True,False,True,False,4,False,"I'm writing this post not about me, but about my borther;

For the past 2 years, he's been in and out of psychiatric hospitals 4 times, with 2 suicide attempts on record, and at this point, I really don't know what I can do to help him.

His biggest reasons for wanting to commit suicide is that he feels his life unfulfilling and that he has no friends or girlfriend, but also he doesn't want to commit to a life of work. I think his problem is also rooted in the years of abuse that he suffered under my mother's roof, and the lack of psychiatric attention he got as a child (as the psychiatrists themselves have said.)

My mother is still a problem because she's not well equipped to help my brother at all; being the root of the issue, she is toxic and still somewhat abusive, and our family is definitely not in a position to help him. I'm not sure where else he could go, I don't really know whether we have any family (saner than us) that can welcome him. He can't go to his father's or his cousin's place because of religious differences, and at this point I'm not sure what we can do to help him.

There's not really that much mental hospitals can do either, especially considering he doesn't have the will, unlike I do, to want to change, which makes it even harder since he declines all psychiatric help and refuses to talk to the psychiatrists from the mental hospital. We know what's causing all his issues now but we still pretty much can't do anything about it.

He also distrusts us and refuses our help.

I think the biggest problem is his environment. If he weren't with us, it would be so much easier for him to get back on his feet. Also the screwed up sites he frequents on the internet, but y'know..

We've been dating for close to 9 months and things are serious. I moved in back in November as I was seeing her everyday. Honestly, I was and still am ok with the decision. I really do feel taken with her and I do love her, but when I moved in is when the trouble started, and not like you think. We coesist rather nicley. Im not a hard person to live with so it was more me getting used to her rules and quirks than the other way a round. Right around 2 weeks in we started having issues with her exhusband and her son. The child isnt the issue either but its relivant to the story. I wont go into details with the ex becasue lets just say its ugly and the child, who wants to consider me his father, is being harmed mentally. His birthday, the holidays, court, work, bills.. it was a tough few months. During these months I feel like ive lost the ability to communicate with my partner and even preform in bed. Ive lost stamina and in some cases interest all together. We got into it last night, not what Id call a fight but, an argument, and It really had me asking myself what my issue is? The arguement was over intimacy. After november, I cant seem to last as long as I used to, nor keep it up. Its not like me at all. She as mad at my and called me selfish because she asked when the last time i masturbated was and I told her that it was ealier in the day. I didnt mention that it was a 30 sec thing and i wasnt even full mast when I was done, but I dont feel like it wouldve mattered. Anyway, its been a while for her. I feel like Ive been kind of a joke in bed and its really affecting our day to day. Shes told me that its not important but it clearly is, well the intimacy part is. Ive asked her what im missing or doing wrong and she pointed me towards a friends episode, which I get the point but at the same time, not really helping. When i as her to show me she tells me that, ""that not fun"". I dont know what to do. I feel like she is explaining things and shes talking to a wall, the wall being me. Should I talk to a therapist? Should i be more outgoing and aggressive? if so, how? im very submissive in nature and outside of work thats always been tough for me. Is this in my head? should I take medication? is this the wrong place to ask these questions?

Can anyone tell im new at this lol?

I don't agree with my psychologist (tw: trauma),0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"So I my psychologist told me I might have PTSD, but I don't think I agree with him.

It all started when my other psychiatrist prescribed me a med called Fluvoxamine for my OCD. It made me go insane! I'd experience severe hypomania every single day! I'd feel intense feelings and sometimes even freeze from stress! 

So now, every time someone repeats a sentence or word (such as ""stop! stop! stop!""), it SOMETIMES makes me remember of how I'd act during those crises and I start having a crisis and even hyperventilating.

But I don't have any other symptom of PTSD. It's just those crises I have when someone repeats a word. It used to be way more intense in the following months to when I experienced the trauma, now I very rarely experience that.

I told my psychiatrist about that and she's still evaluating me for that.

When they shared their stories with me I was heartbroken and knew I had to make some difference to ensure no one else goes through what they went through.

I have a friend who broke down crying today in class. She's the valedictorian, and incredible in so many ways, but feels like she gets absolutely no recognition for her labors. She barely has any friends other than me and a select few of other, and says that people are always talking bad about her. Obviously, she is an extremely hard worker, but says that both her parents and some of her teachers are constantly calling her lazy, and generally belittling her. How her parents then have the audacity to demand a cut of her scholarship money, while also never letting her leave the house except for school and work, and making her take care of them and her siblings all the while(I think her mom has some sort of medical condition).

Today I was being recognized for some stuff that you need to be voted in for by a council of faculty.  Had a whole photoshoot about it and spent the day dressed in a suit and tie. When she saw me she went off into a self loathing rant. About how she thinks she'll never amount to anything, and would've ended up in the same situation no matter how hard she worked. She said she wants to die.

I tried my best to comfort her, to remind her of her successes, how so many people look up to her. She didn't really care. I tried to give her a hug to soothe and calm her, but she just kept ranting through it, not really hugging me back. There's only so much i can give physically, I'm really awkward about it myself too. She has a boyfriend, but it's long distance, and from what I've heard, he's a real piece of work. This is just to say that, love is not really a solution.

I'm currently dealing with some intrusive thoughts about some folks who bullied me.,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Just what it says on the tin. I got bullied by a couple guys at work a few years back and it still grates on me. It relates to another incident I talked about on here a while ago where I got sexually harassed after saying I was straight.

So it's like this: some coworkers ask about my ""type"" and I say that my type doesn't matter because I'm celibate. A couple of guys apparently take that to mean that I'm into some... unconventional things. They repeatedly asked if I ""eat ass,"" made slurping noises when I was around, and laughed when I asked them what that meant. Maybe that's not much as far as bullying goes, but I can't help but flash back to that moment and think about punching them in their faces. I've just never understood people like that.

It also bothers me that this would have likely been considered homophobia if I were gay, but since I'm not it's ""just bullying."" Personally, I think that bullying of any kind should always be treated with the same severity no matter who is being bullied or why. I don't want to minimize anyone's suffering, it just really hurts when people generalize straight white males as ""oppressors"" when we're just as vulnerable to getting bullied as anyone else.

This level of paranoia can't be normal.,3,False,False,True,False,4,False,"I've been paranoid of so many things since I was super young. I'd assume at that age, it was just my imagination running wild, so it wasn't anything serious. When I was around 5 or 6, my bedroom wall had a little spot of water damage. It made the paint bulge, and it looked like an eye. I thought the ""eye"" was watching me constantly, I'd hide from it when I'd change my clothes, I felt like I was being watched when I would play in my room, you get the idea. It scared me. 

As I got older, the paranoia never went away. I figured everyone was going through all of my journals. Any time I would write, which I loved doing, people were always looking over my shoulder or peeping over my arm so they could see what I was writing. Everyone could read my mind, they knew what I was thinking, and no one would ever say anything about it. No matter how embarrassing the thought was. Which led to me trying to monitor my thoughts, so I wouldn't embarrass myself for thinking of something stupid. 

Even now, as a 22 year old, I have these thoughts. I've gotten back into journaling, and I leave it in an old bookbag in my car because I don't want my husband to go through it. When my husband borrows my car, I assume he's gone through it, read it, and knows everything in it. He just won't tell me he's done it. I won't accuse him of doing it because I *know* he doesn't know it even exists. But I feel like he knows and he's read through it. 

I also feel like he's seen everything I've ever googled, posted, every social media account I've ever made, every reddit post I've ever made. I don't think he even knows I use reddit. Or he can hear me when I'm in my car and he's at work or home. Or anywhere that isn't in the car with me. There have been times where I've listened to a random song I haven't listened to in a while, when I'm in my car and I'm alone. Nowhere near home. And then when we're in the car together, he'll play it. It's too strange to be a coincidence, even though that's probably all it is. Or he'll mention something super random, something we've never talked about before, and it's something I had looked up a few days before. 

I can't shake the feeling that I am always being watched. I hate being home alone at night. Sometimes my husband works overnight and I dread it. I'm scared of the dark and how terrified I feel in it. Or how quiet the house is. I can't even go up the stairs, I get this dreadful feeling that someone or something is watching me and is following me up or down the stairs. Sometimes I can't even make myself do it, I just sleep on the couch. When he's not here, I sleep downstairs with some of the lights on and a show playing. I feel like I'm constantly frozen in fear when I'm home alone at night. Sometimes I'll see figures in the corner of my eye, lurking right where I can barely see them. I know it's nothing there, but my *god* it is so fucking scary. 

When I first started seeing my psychiatrist, it was because of a possible mood disorder. The paranoia was nowhere near as bad as it is now. It was almost non-existent, only being an issue here and there. Now, it's an issue almost every day. I don't know when the right time to bring it up would be, I don't want it to seem like I'm hiding things or making things up. It's just progressively gotten worse, and I don't understand why.

Help I’m so tired and I can’t lay down I’m trapped pacing,1,False,False,True,False,4,False,"Help I’m trapped I’m tired and I can’t lay down

My ocd is like 99% about my parents. Well it alternates between mom dad and grandma. The point is I want them to have no affect on my future in any positive manner, and there is this contemplation and improvement I need to have since I haven’t showered in over 2 months or brushed teeth in 2 weeks and I need to have this improvement but I can’t if they have any role in it. I have about 30 water bottles on my floor in an exact evenly spread out manner and a blanket that has very bad energy/germs on it that cannnnnot be touched. Also it is arranged perfectly as well. But either way. By ocd I mean like if my mom drives me to school it ruins my week. Or day at least. I missed the bus and legit was practically crying in the middle of public(nobody there tho ofc it was morning). And for a week after my mom unclogged my toilet which I was gonna do and didn’t even need to be unclogged really it probably could have just been flushed it was literally just toilet paper left over from hand washing from something else, and barely any too, and she refilled my soap bottle I spent every day after school washing hands until like midnight from coming home to get the “mom helping/imperfection” germs off. And would sanitize all day at school pretending to blow my nose as an excuse to sanitize. Well it got to a point I just accepted I’m already a weirdo so fuck it Idfc how weird they think I am for sanitizing. Shit this BETTER BE ANONYMOUS or else ima die. Anyways. I mean I would legit start yelling during my hours long hand washing alone in my bathroom and would go through sometimes I whole roll if not more than a whole roll a day from using it to press the soap. But also the bottles it’s very important that they are last touched when I am thinking perfectly depressing thoughts with no thoughts of parents. Anyways things were perfect, as they usually are since Monday is THE perfect uninfluenced day. (Tuesday has a class my dad helped me choose, so does Wednesday and Friday and Wednesday my othergrandma comes and eats with me and my mom so it makes it fine, but not as perfect as Mondays). Fuck. Now I wrote all this which maybe will lead to a good response which would be allowing something my mom did to have a good affect. So I’ll delete this now. I wrote like an entire essay about my whole situation but I thought it would be allowing something good to come from something my mom did if someone were to reply and solve my issue. Anyways. She did my laundry and moved around my bottles by accident. I ask her every time like please all I ask is that you don’t do anything for me all I want is to do things by myself for myself I will get a job if I have to that’s all I ask. And I know this paints me as a super bitch rude ass kid but still whatever. I’m frozen in time. I can’t go to my dads since my last goodbye to him and his mom/my grandma, was perfect. And I can’t sleep since my bed was touched all over by her, and the horrible floor blanket is on it. And my room is practically destroyed. I mean shit was practically an art piece or a mathematical perfection with how perfect it was. But anyways. I have been pacing. I’m so tired. But I can’t get in that bed. And I needed to for my contemplation to change. I can’t live like this anymore. But because of this it will be weeks before any change happens. So help. I’m stuck. I’ll be standing all night and just like I don’t even know what I’ll do help.
And my jacket was so important it wasn’t washed for so long that it’s like important to me and symbolized how long I’ve been a loser plus it’s been like the one thing I wore throughout all of high school and like I would just keep it but especially like the concept of each underwear and that shirt and shorts they were like “perfect days” things and they had to be dirty to exemplify this contemplation ugh idk, this shit has been going on so long because all I need is one day but imperfections keep coming along so this shit is going to send me insane and I don’t know what to do this is so important of a day(well tomorrow morning but ykwim) and now it’s like ruined and I don’t know what to do I literally was breathing so hard I almost fainted and I think this is so stupid because I was such an average person but sharing my location with my mom for no reason ruined all of my life’s ambitions to get rich and valediction and non profit and change the world and all of that was ruined along with my inner purpose and life and reason for living and now this streak of imperfections I mean I am seriously going insane and I did know what to do, and I did it, but she had to do the laundry so now what another 2 months of being ocd about which clothes I wear on certain days to build up perfect germs on them and then 200 more ocd perfect pees and just oh my god. I mean seriously this could ruin my life. I think it did. I would have payed 100000 I would have gone into debt for the rest of my life for her to not have done this. And triple that for the last 10 times. And I’d be a cripple with one limb to be back on my own cause at least I could still have been mentally in my perfect purity and then gone on to change the world or at least be in perfect 24/7 bliss while not changing the world but having a near perfect life and still doing great to the world anyways. I mean I would have rather died so I guess that doesn’t mean much, but still. Anyways I’m stuck. I’m going insane. This laundry is going to send me to a mental hospital. I can’t lay down. I can’t contemplate. I can’t improve. But I can’t let it harm me either because harm could lead to a greater good in the future so that is still letting something she did do good for me. So help.

"I wouldn't be angry if I found out I had terminal cancer, I'd be elated.",16,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I know I can't take matters into my own hands because my dad, mom, and grandma would quickly follow ... so that's basically murder at that point. 

Then my friends, who are mainly all long-distance at this point, (GASOLINE for the fire of my depression!) would blame themselves and be stuck with that trauma forever. That's a life sentence of misery for people who love me in a healthier and more supportive way than my own parents do. 

My boyfriend would also blame himself, he hasn't been making much time for me whatsoever at all though... so he is certainly not helping. He doesn't know at all how bad my mental health is to be fair.

But man, if I got terminal cancer, that's nobody's fault! Everyone would grieve, maybe in some capacity forever, but they could only be angry at the chaos of the universe, not themselves. I know it's sick to want that when countless families are tormented by it daily but if there was a way to give my health to someone who was terminally ill and take their sickness and die from it, I wouldn't think twice. 

I'm around 80k in debt (all in collections!) because I was financially abused by my ex, I have a boyfriend I adore but have only been seeing a few times a month, he says it will get better when he gets a house and settles into his new job and doesn't have his family ordering him around... but I'm running out of strength to withstand it. 

My mom is extremely abusive because of her NPD and always has been, and that's confusing as hell because she loves me so much but it's also as easy as breathing for her to be horrifically cruel to me. Her emotions dictate my entire life right now. My dad is depressed and unable to leave his abusive girlfriend who hates my guts, he's also in financial hardship. I'm also fucking autistic. And I spent the past two years caretaking for my cruel and psychotic morbidly obese aunt who hallucinated and shat herself in our shared bathroom.... just for my mom to kick her out a few months ago. 

All I have going for me is my looks, even my intelligence hasn't been of much use to me because my autism makes me naïve and people just use me... then my looks make people want to use me more. I can't even count how many rape-attempts I've narrowly escaped, my biggest fear is that next time I won't get away, I'd rather just be killed. 

One of my main ways to deal with the emotional pain is to go online and genuinely compliment people, usually other women, otherwise, I will starve myself, pull out my hair, bash my head against the wall, or furiously smack myself (classic autistic meltdown style). As a consequence of the first coping mechanism, I now have a decent collection of online mutuals who adore me and check up on me daily. 

I feel like I do things that make it impossible for me to off myself but I still fantasize about it constantly. It's madness. I hate how most of my love is online, I haven't hugged my best friend in Korea since the night before she left in August, then I cried so hard I almost threw up on the train because she was the one friend in my city I saw regularly. Modern life is so fucking SAD. And I'm financially ruined so I can't even afford a few hundred dollars to go stay with my best friend in Vancouver for a few days. She tried to come here but I couldn't even get two days off work. I TRY.

I try SO HARD to live a normal healthy life and I grasp and grasp and it all just turns to shit in my hands. I know that subconsciously my bf sees me as a burden because I don't have friends I go out with after work like a normal 20-something, he doesn't care about the money thing, but I know him being my main social life bothers him. I'm friends with my colleagues but two of them have kids and the other one is like 21 and I'm 28. I see people going out in groups and doing things OFFLINE together and I feel so embarrassed and weird. I have a lot of friends, I've worked really hard on building those relationships, but they are in Vancouver and Miami, and Incheon Korea and goddamn Sydney AUSTRALIA. 

My day-to-day is mainly walking on eggshells around my mom and even if I do everything right if she's due for a blow-up she will blow up at me, and it could happen at any time. I'm going insane, my heart starts racing when I hear her footsteps coming up the stairs.

I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,2428,False,False,True,False,102,False,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

a friendship is adding stress but not because of negative things perse`. my own anxieties? desires?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"a friend and i were hanging out a lot, spent a couple weeks toying with dating. became friends. i was put on some anti manic medication when i suddenly had my first bipolar episode of my life... who knew.  during this time her and i stopped talking as we just needed space with what both of us were dealing with.

now months later we are friends but its so different.  i feel the crazy comfort is gone. she leaned on me for a lot of stuff, we cried together, i hung out at her place till wee hours of the morning. we always texted each other quickly, made time for each other.

now we talk and such but all the super closeness is gone.  i find its causing me anxiety or maybe a despair at what i feel we have lost?

a big weight here is she really showed me who i want to be in a relationship. i had quite a few firsts with her emotionally and from a comfort stand point. 

the point of this is that im hung up on a friendship that i want to be as it was, when there is a good chance it wont. id like to feel safe and comfortable again with her and it would seem im willing to do just about anything to work towards that.  seems extreme for a friendship?

i think this is causing me some anxiety. maybe even destabilizing but its hard to tell what is from this friendship or what is from me still reeling from the mental health stuff.   i know when im out with people my anxieties go away, when i talk to her they go away. when im alone they flair up.  so... idk, this is all new to me",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41520,Hot,2023,3,Very high,0,99,1485,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0
Realising I might have depression,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Last week I (35m) had a conversation with my doctor regarding my mental health. I thought I was approaching a burnout because I have not stopped the past 10 years. When I walked into my GP's office and closed the door I basically bursted out into tears. My GP suggested I might suffer from a depression.

Hearing a medical professional telling me this felt both like a relieve and a shock. Whilst it was pleasant to hear that what I was feeling was not 'normal' and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, on the other hand it was shocking to hear that I was suffering from this.

All our lives we are told to man up and that we have it good compared to the Olden days. It feels like we don't have the right to feel like this. Or in my case, I even felt weak because there are other people out there that have it way worse than me.

The first few days of my sick leave I spend sleeping and thinking. I'm trying to understand my feelings, which for me mostly comes down to feeling useless and a burden for others (even though I know in my heart that I am not, this is the way I feel). 

My doctor gave me the homework to go for forest walks and eat healthy this first week. I have not gotten myself for the first step yet (but I did improve my food intake).

As a result I feel bad about going back to the doctor, because I could not even follow a simple instruction. I feel like I am failing her.

The friends of the girl I like told me that she likes me but she never messages me back and the girl my friend likes likes me so it just messes up my friendships. It feels like my life is on the verge of falling to pieces. I forgot to do one of my maths tests which was 25% of my grade, I scraped it back and got 100% on the most recent one but I just feel like a failure because I never even tried to get into university all my exams were cancelled and the tests they gave us were easy as shit so it feels like I don't deserve to be here. I was at the club with a girl and then the girl I liked came up to me and then she left and I was just alone and it feels like I never stopped feeling alone since then.

I was like six when I found it maybe. Well finally told my therapist about it the other day decided to go dig through the old family movies and guess what I found... I feel like it's inappropriate that's what my therapist said at the least. I'm just like is this abuse though? I don't really remember it but watching it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and angry that something like that would happen to me and my mom would let it happen and defend the person who did it. Was this just a normal thing like my mom said? Filming a nearly 4-year-old playing around naked and commenting on it and encouraging him to do so? For context both my mom and her sister were sexually abused as children which makes me think this is either an extreme lack of boundaries or them carrying their abuse on to me. I want to go public about this abuse but I'm worried I'm just going to get minimized like I was by my mom when I found it when I was a kid and said it was wrong and disturbing but I didn't really have the words to explain it then or the understanding I do now as an adult.

Tired of all the pandemic video conferences? Here is a bit unexpected advice on how to decrease this fatigue.

Researches say that when participants of the video call do not mute themselves, they are less tired after the meeting. And even stronger effect is achieved if person has a strong sense of belonging to the group - that it if he or she can talk, propose, argue, ask, support, assign and take tasks, and otherwise participate in the group processes - then fatigue after the meeting is even more decreased.

Besides, for already some time we know what such meetings with camera turned on (not just looking at the circles with initials on them) also strengthen sense of being present and connected (which strengthens sense of belonging to the group) and so decreases the fatigue as well. 

Of course, you will need to comb your hair and dress for that. But hey, perhaps not being so tired of all of these calls is also not such a bad idea?

"Mom w/ Eating Disorder, Alcoholism, Depression, etc.. How to get her help?",1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Greetings,
  

  
Throw away account for obvious reasons, as well as reasons you'll read below should you so choose to.
  

  
TW: ED, Alcoholism.
  

  
**How can I convince my mom to get help, and if she refuses, force her?**
  

  
I want to start off by saying that I had a wonderful childhood. My mother never physically or mentally abused me growing up. I had everything I ever wanted, so I maintain a relationship with my mother and want the best for her. I love my mom, I was considered a ""mama's boy"" and I just want her healthy and her to stick around for her full life, which is what she deserves. She currently is between 46 and 54 years of age. I would be more specific, I just really don't want her to find this. I live 20 hours away, so I am unable to support her in person, but my father and brothers are home with her.
  

  
My mom has an eating disorder, its very obvious. Whether she realizes this, or if its even been diagnosed is something I don't know. She will not eat more than a few nibbles of food or candy a day, and it has been this way for at least 10 years. She probably weighs 80 pounds, and you can certainly see it when you meet her. Still, she blames ""just being skinny"" on our genetics, as everyone in her family is skinny, but not underweight. My first indication that she had an eating disorder, and not some other health issue that truly prevented her from eating, was the discovery of dozens of boxes of laxatives that were hidden in the house. I believe that this, along with her alcoholism, has caused all of her health issues, or at least most of them. She has all the tale-tell signs of an ED, so I wont go into it much further.
  

  
My mom is an alcoholic. She drinks every day, not to the point of being fall-down drunk, but definitely 6 drinks or more everyday. While hospitalized for a short period of time due to breaking a bone, she was told by the attending physician that if she did not change she would end up in a nursing home, or worse. She was sent home with painkillers. She had told everyone she had quit drinking and was gaining weight. The weight gain was true, which was amazing. I was genuinely happy for my mothers future for the first time in a very long time. However, my brother's alcohol collection of hard liquor was completely drained after a few weeks, so she was drinking this entire time. Father and brothers confronted her, she got very defensive and said she has to drink, and it was left at that. Painkillers ran out, she continued to drank, and lost all the weight she had gained, possibly more.
  

  
My mom has health issues from her ED and alcoholism. She has osteoporosis (brittle bones), and has broken bones due to falling, sometimes while sitting in bed or on the toilet. She has fluid build up in her abdomen (the medical term for that condition eludes me). She has had her gallbladder removed. I also believe this has severely impacted her cognitive ability - she cannot do every day normal things like canceling subscriptions or anything else to do with a computer. Which she used to be able to, she has historically worked an office setting and is required to do so. She was fired from her most recent job in 2023 because of poor performance, or at least that is what she told me. I believe she could have gotten caught drinking at work.
  

  
Within the past 5 years or so, my mother has gotten paranoid. My brothers have told me that they will be laughing about something unrelated to her in the living room, and she will walk in to say something to the effect of ""why are you laughing at me"". She believes my father has conditioned my brothers into hating her. She tells her friends that my family mentally abuses her, which has caused one to reach out to me, to which I explained she is not being abused, she's just going through some stuff. This person immediately told her what I said, and now she is angry with me. If she overhears discussion between my brothers or father and me on the phone, she will immediately accuse us of ""talking sh\*t"". She has told me on the phone that no one at home loves her, which I cannot convince her otherwise no matter what I point out or say. In short, any time someone expresses concern, no matter how gentle, she will get extremely defensive and start bringing up any shortcoming that person has faced, whether in the past, current, or even made up.
  

  
My father has tried to convince her to get help, but she refuses. I have tried as well, and it is met with severe backlash and attacks on me.
  

  
TL;DR - My middle-aged mother is severely underweight, has an ED, and is an alcoholic, which has caused health issues and injuries. She is extremely defensive and thinks none of our loving family cares for her. What can I do to convince her to get help?

I think I'm falling back into depression again,2,True,False,True,False,1,False,"Last semester, during my second year of college, I started falling into depression, mixed with anxiety. I couldn't even eat because my anxiety would take control of my stomach and basically everything would give me stomach aches. I had started to go to therapy and it kinda helped.

Now we are in March and I feel totally hopeless again. I barely have any strength to get up in the mornings, I lost my motivation and excitement for most things I loved and for my major( which I know I love but I just feel numb about it). Apart from all of that, my overthinking is getting the best of me and I can't control it anymore. I'm crying myself to sleep half of the week and I assume that the person that cares the most about me really doesn't and that everything he says about being my best friend and caring for me is all bullshit and I end up spiraling and getting mad at him really easily.

Really struggling again after another therapy session talking about my recent sudden termination with my previous therapist,8,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
Referring to the stuff about my therapist of 6 years suddenly terminating me a few weeks ago.

I had an appointment yesterday with the social worker I saw for therapy as a teen scheduled from a few weeks ago, so I decided to go to wrap things up with him while I wait for my appointment with the therapist I’ve chosen to see long term later this week.

Opening up about it again definitely opened the wounds that it feels like I’m forcing shut 24/7 these days.

I think what’s most difficult from talking about it yesterday and feeling emotions about it lately is - how much my therapist understood how she did things would mirror my past abandonments. That my ex girlfriend suddenly abandoning me without closure or anything at all was the trauma I started going to her for. How she encouraged maternal transference and attachment. Knew how my mom abandoned me as a kid. And then she went and did the same thing - abandoned me suddenly out of the blue without warning, without closure, without even letting me say goodbye to her in person after as close as we were and attachment I had etc.

It hurts so much knowing that understands all that on a personal level, but was still willing to recreate the same experience for me.

At this point, I feel like I would still be hurt and scared, but I would feel a lot less traumatized and abandoned if I had gotten the typical termination process of a few sessions or so to understand things, to help transition, to get all the feelings out, to not be blindsided etc. But she wouldn’t even grant me that.

It also hurts because looking back, it was like one bad session, and then the next week she just up and decides to terminate me on a whim.

Even in spite of her burn out, I had made a lot of progress in the last year & this year.

We worked a lot on self love and healing my inner child and things of that nature. One of my biggest accomplishments was the last couple Christmases having them for myself and like taking care of and providing love for myself, and feeling like I had learned to love myself and be independent. I just remembered today that I did the same thing on Easter a couple months ago.

I’ve been trying to tap into the the self love, but it feels like the way things have happened have caused so much self hatred to return that I can’t do it. My inner child feels so betrayed, both by my therapist and myself for allowing that part of myself to be vulnerable to her.

I’ve tried to tap into or otherwise take care of the inner child part of myself, but it feels like there is just pain there now. I bought a few stuffed animals for myself because I feel a lot of vulnerability to that, for Christmas and Easter and etc., and I got them out and tried to comfort myself and let myself cry and feel the pain, and reparent myself and tell myself that it would be okay and everything.

But it feels like because my self love and stuff like that originated from feeling safe and cared for in the attachment that I had with my therapist - I don’t know how to describe, it’s like it’s just associated with her. The act of trying to self love, reparent myself, be vulnerable with myself and do the things I learned to do - it’s like it triggers the abandonment trauma from my therapist instead of allowing me to love myself. I don’t know if that’s exactly what’s going on but it feels like something like that.

Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest. I’m feeling very alone and scared. I have therapy again tomorrow with the therapist I will be seeing regularly now and will be talking about this stuff again, and I’m scared of that. I’m scared because none of the therapists I’ve tried in the last few weeks have been remotely like my old therapist, they don’t understand me, they’re not able to “dig in” to the trauma and understand it to know how to approach it, they don’t pick up on things. One of the trauma therapists I saw in the last few weeks told me to binge watch a TV show and get attached to a character to fill the trauma void left by my therapist FFS. So I’m scared the same thing will happen as it did for decades before my old therapist, and that I won’t get the help I need and that works, and I’m just going to continue suffering like this.",False,False,ptsd,100207,Controversial,2023,6,Very low,4,123,4231,negative,positive,False,False,0,1,0

Their term was ""let go"" but i told my supervisor thanks for rescuing me.

I really need to let out my frustration and concerns as they arise and not let them explode like i did when i went personal on my coworker.

Quit Meds Started Carnivore,0,True,False,True,False,12,False,"Hey everyone, I’ve (30M) had bouts of anxiety my entire life, but it seems the older I get the more anxiety I experience. I went to my doctor 3-4 months ago and my bloods all returned normal. He diagnosed me with anxiety/depression due to family history and my visible signs of anxiety. I took 25mg of Zoloft for months, upping it up to 50mg, back down to 25mg. I tried to quit at one point and experienced the worst anxiety/panic attacks. I couldn’t even talk to people or I’d be shaky and scared. Absolutely nuts. The dreams on Zoloft were terrible and the meds made me feel extremely flat and uninterested with life. I thought this was going to be my life moving forward until I researched and started the carnivore diet.

Basically you cut out all the crap that we eat in our every day life (Standard American Diet). All the fast food, seed oils, sugar, plants etc. These foods cause inflammation, brain fog, anxiety and depression. 

My diet on carnivore now consists of 80% grass fed animal fat, 20% protein from grass fed animals. That’s it.
I also eat a banana or 2 and some raw honey every day. 

When starting this diet you go through a period of adaptation and detoxification. It usually takes a couple weeks to a month. During this period, I quit the Zoloft. I figured if I’m going to feel bad for this period why not quit the meds while I’m at it. The first 3 weeks sucked. Tired, anxious, diarrhea, etc. But I could slowly feel my self improving during this time. I am now a month in and I am happy to say I feel fucking amazing. Way less anxiety, no depression, great mood, great sleep, higher libido, fuller muscles. 

If you are a meat eater and want to give this diet a shot there is plenty of information online and on YouTube from reliable sources/doctors. I figured I’d drop this in here and maybe it will help someone. Anxiety is the absolute worse and if it means I have to cut out all the crap they push on us to feel better, sign me up. Hope this helps!

New Job is Increasing My Anxiety,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"So as the title says I got a new job and since starting it my anxiety has gone through the roof and I’m noticing some signs of depression. 

For context I was working an amazing job that I loved and then the majority of my team got laid off due to massive budget cuts. I jumped into a new job out of fear of being unemployed and having to touch my partners and I savings. 

The job I took turned out to be a mess and a toxic workplace. I feel constantly micromanaged/judged and also poorly trained. There is very bag communication among my team and drama I have been placed in the middle of.  Looking back I should have saw the red flags in the interview process but ignored them again out of desperation for work.

I have been there for about 1.5 months and every morning I work myself up about having to go in, have had mornings where I cry on the commute (not a crier usually), and will sit in my car until I will myself to go in. Recently I’ve noticed I haven’t been eating or been hungry and only eat when I get home and my partner encourages me to - this is resulting in some weight loss.

I’ve been applying to other jobs but where we live there are limited options. Everytime I get a rejection email I work myself back up about having to be stuck in my current position. 

I am not sure if anyone has any advice on how to handle this so that my mental and physical health don’t plummet anymore.

Bipolar ,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I have been bipolar my whole life. I only recently knew what it was. I was always under the impression that bipolar had to do with anger not sadness like depression. However I don't feel sad I feel worthless, empty, a waste of time and energy. Just a complete failure and never gets any better. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 10 and I'm 24 I've taken antidepressants they never really help. I want a more permanent solution I don't want to feel like I'm better of dead for the rest of my life. Everything always gets harder for me I fail a lot with everything.

1. My love life is garbage all my closet friends have girlfriend, wives, or sleep around a lot. I can't even get a woman to think of me more than a friend or an emotional support bestie. I really haven't ever been a relationship, but once and it wasn't one she only used me for money. My name is her contacts was ""Free Shit 🤑"" I never notice until I started reflecting she never called me my real name only my nickname. I fail so much at it yet I only blame myself. I can't even cry about because I always think of someone's been through so much worse my pain is so little like I don't matter.(This toxic behavior is probably what ruined my brain)

2. I can never keep down my weight the most I ever lost was 40lbs and gaing back so fast I'm 24 6'1 and 365.6lbs I'm morbidly obese. I get happy for bit lose a little weight (3 - 5lbs) then some how I just get knocked down from my high/positive streak by life and I binge it so I don't feel numb over indulging in the enjoyable of eating something delicious. Sometimes all food taste the same it not even in enjoyable when you feel hollow.

3. I can never keep a job I don't feel like myself without employment and financial security and I never had it ever. I work my ass off when ever get a job and my employer takes and advantage of that they don't pay me more they just make me hustle for the same scraps. Until I can't do it anymore and burn myself out then out of nowhere I get much less hours and less pay or just get let go. No matter how hard I work I'm always first on the chopping block. 

I have more but this is getting too long. Overall I hate myself and I don't know how to change or get better. I barely can remember my past and I think it my minds way of protecting itself so I don't break out in tears. I don't think much about anything when I'm thinking I think about nothing my concentration is worthless.

Here are my thoughts. Religion, as I see it, is an attempt by people to explain the world around them and imagine its creator. However, I do not believe in such an idea, considering attempts to find explanations in religion simply comforting. The concept of spirituality doesn’t seem different to me; it is linked to the search for meaning too.

All these synchronicities and signs spoken about by believers are probably just attempts by people to comfort themselves, thinking that there is some plan behind all events. I tend to think that we, humans, are just rational beings on Earth, capable of asking ourselves these questions.

Our consciousness is just a part of our brain, which, by the way, can sometimes function improperly. We are just creatures on Earth, essentially not so different from a cat or a tree. We are just thinking beings on this planet, and our lives unfold against the backdrop of a vast cosmos.

We live in a society where we are sustained, and our mental problems are a result of existing on Earth. Sometimes I feel that we, as beings, cannot freely choose how to live because our circumstances also determine us. Our mental problems are part of life, and we try to understand how to deal with them.

Life on Earth is an incredibly wondrous phenomenon. We, humans, animals, plants - we are all part of this amazing world. Beyond Earth, there are no special meanings or creators; it is just our part of the Universe. We are all the same, regardless of race or creed.

I often contemplate life from the perspective of someone else observing us as strange beings trying to understand the meaning of life. How another cosmic race might marvel at our ability to create art or music that can evoke strong emotions in people, or our rapid technological evolution, which might seem like madness to them. And while our life may seem strange and uncertain to them, for us, it is our only reality. 
But even despite the absurdity of this situation, I do not feel sadness. For me, this is the only reality, and I accept it as it is.

Moreover, the notions of good and bad or happiness are arguably constructs of our brain, and we can only adjust them through medication or conversations. It's not in the state's interest to have sick individuals, and children get cancer not because the devil exists, but sometimes simply due to genetic variations, like different eye colors. The brain of a murderer is the same brain that somehow came into existence in this world; it just functions in a particular way.
 
You people should at least feel a little good about being given some time to observe this universe from a human perspective. You still have time to observe nothing if you know what I mean.

what happened then is what i can only describe of quickly going totally blind, and then blacking out/fainting for what my dad said was 3 minutes. he said i fell off the bed, he waved his hand in front of my face to see if my eyes followed it (they didn't), but i was entirely conscious during it according to him. i do not remember much as it felt like maybe 30 seconds to me until i regained my vision and could see my surroundings. he called 911 but i was sitting up and talking fine by the time he reached them so the paramedics didn't come

anyways. i went to the urgent care my mom works at after this and they said i had a panic attack. ive had them before , but NEVER to this degree? all my vitals, blood work, etc... were completely fine but im still doubtful.

i can't think of a particular reason, trigger, or stressor for this; and I'm just wondering if this is normal for a panic and i should just continue with what my doc recommends (drinking more water, getting therapy again, new psychiatrist) or if i should be more concerned.",False,False,Anxiety,661114,New,2024,2,Medium,0,92,1582,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Hes taken countless pictures of the ""neighbors"" in the driveway or lamp and everyone says they see nothing. Hes never hallucinated before, and hes a mans man, a former ironworker and for him to act this way is not normal. Its causing distress and my mom is worried he will go over there and attack the neighbors with a bat. Hes up all night saying he sees them in the lamp.

Then he will be normal again for a bit and gets paranoid and starts seeing things. His kidney doctor wasnt a help and said its a mental issue that needs to be addressed, but my dad thinks hes normal and wont get help.

I don't see most things to fruition; enjoying the preparation, the hunt, the gathering instead. This mainly manifests in my relationships with men, which are usually limited to a couple years at the most, and my hobbies or goals, which end up sitting there unfinished or even unbegun. These things are always better when there is distance between us; the idea of them is safe and satisfying. The reality never lives up to my expectations or hopes.

My mother left when I was 2, and I spent so much of my life missing her deeply, feeling that if she were just around, my life would be so much better. I developed pretty significant issues with abandonment, trust, promiscuity, and drugs/alcohol. Through years of therapy and self-help, I've grown away from these things and healed tremendously. But this particular defect persists and pervades my life; I seem unable to achieve contentedness, let alone success in these departments.

i desperately needed rest,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"when i think back to my teenage years, which were possibly my most suicidal, it seems like all i really wanted was rest.  fantasies like being diagnosed with some fatal illness were so appealing because i'd have that period of dying to just stop and rest and not have to care about all my obligations.  i just needed some fucking relief from all the pressure and pain and loneliness and anger.  

another common fantasy of mine at that age was being able to stop time.  i remember telling my brother about this and being shocked it had no appeal to him at all.  he was like 'why?  that would be so boring, you'd just be by yourself the whole time'  i was like, ya, that's the whole appeal: unlimited time by myself.

i don't see death this way anymore, though.  i don't think it's an opportunity for rest.  i don't think rest exists outside of our mortal experience, even.  i think you're either just dead without the consciousness to feel anything or you're into some other existence where nothing from your time on earth applies.

I need help please,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Im not sure what is happening. About 3-4 months ago i started having heart palpations. I went to the ER couple of times but everything looked fine. About 2 months ago I got sick and had a bronchitis. One night I was watching something and all of a sudden I felt this weird noise. I got up and noticed I feel off balance, had a „rushing“ noise in my ear and everything sounded too loud. This made me very scared but I managed to find some sleep and the next day it was basically gone. From this moment on I felt like everything just went downhill tho. I started having breathing difficulties over the next 2 months, random chest pain and all sorts of issues with my body. I went to a cardiologist, got my lung X rayd, bloodwork everything. Only my lung X ray showed some problems but that is very common for a long time smoker. I stopped smoking right after (which is now 3 weeks ago approximately). About 1 week ago I all of a sudden had spells of feeling lightheaded & couldn’t feel my legs properly. This really freaked me out and I feel like that was kind of the tipping point. Since than nothing is normal. I feel „disconnected“ from reality, everything feels kind of surreal. Very much like a state of derealisation. My arms and my legs muscles feel weak and hurt randomly, as if I went to the gym. I wake up crying everyday and just feel like my heads gonna explode, thoughts all over the place and wondering what’s wrong with me and if I ever will be normal again. I feel like I’m actually going insane and have no idea what’s happening. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and panick disorder 6 years ago, but it was very quite for the past years. Now all of a sudden it feels like everything is exploding. And this goes on the whole day. I can’t work, I can’t leave the house nothing. Am I having a mental breakdown??? Is this anxiety/panic or does it sound like something else?

Please someone who experienced something similar tell me what’s happening, I’m really scared.

D&D character with PTSD questions (sorry if this type of post is not allowed),0,False,False,True,False,4,False,"So I myself am suffering from a PTSD from being bullied in my childhood and other things that I might discuss later.

I mostly put my time and energy in writing and love D&D and role playing my characters. I try to make them all unique and memorable and always strive to make them feel real as possible.

Now I had this interesting character who is suffering from PTSD as she has quite the typical scarring main character background, but instead of being cheery and only being there to make the character feel interesting I thought it would be something to make the background have some impact on her.

She is based off of Guts, the main character from berserk, where she has a lot of trust issues, lack of parent figures, trouble with physical contact and the only outlet and place she feels in control is in battle. I’ve discussed some of the triggers she has with my girlfriend who does a lot of research into this kinda stuff and she says that my character seems to be pretty consistent with her traumas and her unhealthy way of dealing with them.

The question I have is though, is how it would manifest over the years, as I had the idea that the character at the time of playing would be around 50 years old. She had no real healthy coping mechanism or any good outlet, hasn’t been very open towards others except her wife who she spent time with but she had died in a horrible fashion so that made her close up again. 

Would triggers, certain traumas and such that you had gained since childhood still remain really bad at your 50th without any good coping mechanism or outlet? She also has gone through some pretty scarring events between her childhood and the age she is now.

Again, very sorry if these kind of questions are inappropriate on a sub like this. It didn’t seem a good question to ask on a D&D related sub since this really is about making a character with PTSD feel accurate or at least consistent. 

I would really appreciate any feedback and please be nice. I’m not as well read in these type of subjects as my girlfriend is.",False,False,ptsd,100206,Controversial,2019,2,Very high,0,77,2051,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0
My mental health ( tw sh+ sa),3,False,False,True,False,1,True,"After braking up with my ex I became homeless and was staying with a friend. My ex was abusive while we lived together and I have a problem with stopping substances when using them (more so in the past I'm trying to be better now for my new relationship). Everyone knew this and the friend I was staying with also knew this as I told them so many times, while drunk and sobbing my heart out about past abuse of every kind, shed always make me drunk more and then we would apparently have sex but I could barely remember any of the times I said yes and I'm scared that she did assault me as well. 
I mean I know she did because I never remember saying yes half the time and I also remember shed be pushy about doing it and would say stuff like ""she wouldn't be able to this when she leaves"" and stuff. I just don't wanna think someone who was ment to help me would hurt me, after I told her how many times other have done the same thing to me. 
I'm so scared of what this is doing to me, I feel so guilty because I should kf seen this happening and I should of stopped drinking as often and I should of known better. But I still let it happen. I feel so stupid and useless because I couldn't remember anything about what happened at hers. I have little to no memory of staying with her, it never ends for me. 
She made drinks really strong and would always make us drink a lot, she was bigger then me and can handle alcohol better then me, and after that I don't remember. Even when others would tell her we should stop and have a brake wed wait and then shed suggest we drink more so I did. Is it my fault because I like to drink? Was I asking for it because I was drinking?
I feel so ducking dirty because of this, there's nothing I can do about it because when I tried talking to them I messed up by acting like I did when I was a kid and saying whatever would make the other person not hate me or something. I feel so useless because of this.

I can't stop thinking about all of the times I was assaulted and it makes me feel so gross and dirty and all I wanna do is hurt myself so much. I don't even want to wake up half the time but I do be abuse then I get to be with my bf.

Found out my abuser (my dad) has mild autism (SCD),2,False,False,True,False,1,True,"Found out my abuser (my dad) has mild autism (SCD)

Over the past year in Therapy, I found out I experienced covert sexual abuse (dad sexualizing me by staring at body, making inappropriate comments about body, flirting by sitting on his lap and cuddling up until I was a teenager) and emotional incest (dad used me as his emotional/intimate/affectionate support he was not getting from my mom). His love was also conditional because when I did not fulfill his needs he was rejecting and emotionally abusive calling me all kinds of names like monster, whore, narcissistic, etc.

So I just found out on Friday he has Social Communication Pragmatic Disorder which some people call mild autism or “autism lite.” Basically he has all the communication issues as someone with autism but he doesn’t have the restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. I’ve read a lot about autism and people on the spectrum (even high functioning) often have poor social and sexual boundaries and also tend to be more sexual deviant than people with out the disorder (I can link these articles if anyone is interested). People on the spectrum also tend to have lower empathy which may explain how my dad did not see/feel the negative impact of sexualizing his own daughter like Someone not on the spectrum would.

So I’ve spoken to some therapists and sexual violence advocates about it. A lot of them have said this can help you explain and understand why he did what he did but it is not an excuse for bad behavior. Another therapist said him not knowing what is socially appropriate plus him learning sexualized behavior from his own father explains some of his behavior but the fact that he was attracted to his daughter is another issue—sexual deviance. Another advocate said, “now that he has his diagnosis, watch his next step. If he really cares, he will do anything he can to work on his issues that affected you. Like holding himself accountable and being honest about his actions and be willing to dig dip within his self and history to get better. Parents owe it to their kids to say they really messed up, they love you and will do everything they can to fix it and not do it again. Plus your dad has his PHD so I know he is smart enough to figure out the family dynamics and improve it. His job is to prove to you he is a safe person to be around, not the other way around.”

I guess I am processing this new diagnosis of him. I think knowing he has this diagnosis makes me less angry with him and more empathetic because he didn’t really know what he was doing was wrong. After I had accused him of what he did, he was genuinely mad and confused because he didn’t think it was sexual abuse because he never touched me (rigid thinking—feature of autism). But he also accused me of lying and making it up and made himself to be the victim (shows immaturity and low empathy). One thing he did after I confronted him three years ago, is he stopped staring and looking at me. And once again made himself like the victim, “I can’t look at you without you thinking I’m staring sexually at you..” then he also said he has stopped staring at women in General for longer than 3 seconds. So I think in his mind, he might thing he has already fixed the problem. In the past he admitted he might of stared but it wasn’t sexual. And then earlier this year he said I may be making up those events when he stared because he doesn’t remember it.

One thing I will say is, I will still have limited contact with him and maintain restricted boundaries because my ptsd symptoms act up when I am around him.

"Pretty bad spot im in, need motivation to get better and not let my mental illness to get ahold of me",0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"So basically the story is (going to leave out some parts to avoid being triggered) ive had a month of facing tics when i was 2 years old, then any ocd and Tourettes symptoms disappeared or was silenced in the background from age 3 to 13. At age 13, ocd symptoms came at me like a car crash, had symmetrical ocd, doorknob/gas stove doubt checking ocd, had the reading ocd(retyping words over ans over again and rereading words over and over again), had the touching something touch it again to cancel out negative shit from it ocd and then religion ocd(scrupulosity) etc etc (more different types as age progressed). At the end of age 17 had a huge trigger moment and developed the hardest form of ocd i have ever faced in my life in my opinion… pure-o. Been struggling with it since. Im 20 now about to turn 21 in a few months. From end of age 17 to age 20 i started psychiatry for the first time and have been on initially prozac then Luvox, vistaril, from 17 to current(age 20). Luvox helps my ocd tremendously, not completely but to the point where i can function normally.From age 18 to now (20) i also got professionally and critically diagnosed with PTSD, GAD(generalized anxiety disorder), non-chronic depression, Sustance abuse disorder and lastly ADHD being the most recent one. After switching over to my new psychiatrist, i never informed her of me having a substance abuse disorder and she forgot to take my collaterall for the adhd diagnosis. I unfortunately was playing the innocent guy acting like im super scared and anxious to even start stimulants, or asking her specific questions that made it look like im the opposite of an addict, very pro-health, and encouraging dosage safety, complaining why ppl abuse them, acting like i barely felt anything when i took 30mg irs in the past and complained how bs it is when ppl say they get a rush of energy euphoria and hyperfocus as i didnt get any of that shit from it(playing like the high enough dose is barely effective making her think i have really bad adhd to get higher dosages prescribed to get higher). Also i have in between mild to severe levels of adhd diagnosed from my old psychiatrist but didn’t purposely tell that to new psychiatrist. So basically now im on aderall xr 40mg a day. This dosage is helping my adhd to the point where its 100% not affecting me. But also 15mg or 20mg does the trick. But i keep lying to get higher dosages because of dopamine telling me to get as much as i can for purposes of me being able to take more to get high or maybe sell some for quick cash. I dont want to do either of those but its so hard and brutal to ignore that dopamine kick when i think of getting more aderalls for purposes of selling and getting a higher high. Unfortunately aderalls make my anxiety a little bad but my ocd brutal, back to the days when i never took ssris for ocd. Those days were my hardest in pure o ocd. And every time i take more and more aderall my ocd goes to that brutal level again. Once the aderall wears off and i take the luvox at night i feel better much better, but not to the point where i was super good taking only luvox and vistarils. But without the aderalls when im on 0mg of aderall that day, my adhd gets sooooo bad, so hard to bear and so hard to avoid. Ive given my mom my aderalls now and told her to not give it to me for a week no matter what. Withdrawals for aderalls for me arent bad  aswell as xanax which i found super surprising but ig my body chemistry is built specifically to fight against those drugs withdrawal effects. But anyways the point is im an aderall addict, not as bad as the ones u hear doing 80-100 to even more per day, but still bad enough for it to be detrimental to not only my physical health but mental health. And its so hard for me to tell her the aderalls make my ocd worse because once she finds that out, thats it no more aderalls. She wud try another stimulant with added non stimulants, but idk why its just hard for me to let go of taking the aderalls. Ik im going to get a lot of harsh judgement from this post, but i want you to understand that ive only told specific points in the story that are cherripicked to portray my problem atm. Ik every aspect defines a person but my problems and mental health issues are only a part of who i am. The rest of me is a person who only judges ppl based on their character, who always gives compliments, who always spreads positivity and the importance of traits that help you be real and not condescending, a person who consistently takes care of my parents as they are getting old, a person who does anything to prevent her mom with severe arthritis from doing chores and so on. I just wanted to say that not to make me look good or whatever but to show that this dilemna im going thru does not mean i am a whole bad person.

Physical symptoms? ,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"A little backstory first. I (21M) was hospitalized for Myocarditis exactly a year ago. Since then I have experienced chest pain along with dozens of other symptoms I never experienced prior.

My symptoms: full body weakness that lasts weeks at a time, chest pain, heart palpitations (PVCs), dizziness, head rush sensation, frequent muscle spasms especially in my stomach, weird fatigue sensations that pulse every now and then. The list goes on and on. 

Are these symptoms of anxiety? Especially the full body weakness? I do not feel like an anxious person, but the toll of chronic pain for over a year has definitely done something.

Being depressed and having depression are different.,2523,True,False,True,False,160,False,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time.

We have all the power we need within ourselves.,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Sometimes we feel like we don't have enough power to accomplish things. We may feel like we don't know enough or we are not competent and we start feeling less of ourselves. We feel powerless.

**The problem with that thinking** is that when we allow ourselves to go low and powerless we are starting to believe it. We may even start thinking that we are not good enough for this job or project. We look around for any confirmation of that thoughts and sometimes we end up projects without execution.   
That's the power of our mind.

All the power we need is within ourselves. We just need to **access it and maintain an unshakable balance**. It doesn't matter if you are young or adult - you have that power, you were born with it.

**The fundamental rule to access power is to always believe in yourself.** 

Believe that you can and deserve it. When we believe in ourselves we access the energy of certainty - the energy of creation that flows through the universe and helps us building things that we could never imagine.

I feel suicidal because of my parents 3 plus year long toxic manipulation but they provide too much for me to move out that I won't get outside of home if I moved,6,True,False,True,False,1,False,My life has been depressing since October of 2019 when I made a mistake and dropped some stuff because I tried to hold too much and forgot to put my phone in my pocket earlier.

Intimacy difficulties in my healthy relationship post trauma,5,False,False,True,False,2,True,"I am diagnosed with PTSD and am also demisexual. I have had multiple instances of SA throughout my life, some more traumatic than others. Fortunately, I have had a great experience with EMDR and a wonderful therapist. I also have a wonderful partner now who I love and care about deeply. 

Unfortunately I have been experiencing bodily dissociation during intimacy (no flashbacks involved) that has caused me to suffer from female sexual dysfunction. I love this man with my whole being and he is incredibly understanding but it's embarrassing to say the least when my body doesn't respond to him because of past experiences. 

My therapist is wonderful but is asexual herself so she can't assist me in anything sex-related. Sometimes my partner tells me that he feels bad that he is unable to get me aroused and I have no idea how to even explain what happens in my body. 

All I know is that in the midst of intimacy my body feels far away and any sensations that occur are barely registered in my brain. It's definitely nothing to do with his skill as a partner as he puts in way more work than anyone I've been with. 

I used to not even be able to orgasm with anyone in the same room as me and now I'm able to do so with the use of toys when I'm with him (only if I am controlling them) but still nothing he does can stop my body from dissociating.

"Weird, vague, half-remembered stimuli that freaks me out. What is it?",0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Bear with me. It's 4:30 in the morning, and I've got *no* clue how to accurately put this shit into words when I'm not sleepy.

There's these two strange stimuli I get every now and then that just freak me out a little. It's really hard to describe, but it feels like some half-remembered memory. They're just random sensory bits that I'll just suddenly feel every now and then. It's weird, though, because I can imagine the sensations right now, but that doesn't freak me out.

But rarely, like, once or twice a year, something will trigger it in my mind, and I'll be able to recreate it in my mind much more vividly. It just randomly hits me, and I feel this weird sort of dread, like I don't want to know where the hell this stimulus is from.

I apologize for how vague and weird this sounds, I'm at just as much of a loss as you commenters probably are. But it hasn't hit me in, like, six months, so I'm not going to describe it exactly as it feels.

Right, so, the sensations themselves. There's two.

First one. Imagine a makeup removal sponge. No seriously. It's some object in that shape and size, but thicker, more cubic, harder, and more gummy-like in how it looks. That, but with a strange smell. Like a plastic-y smell. When it hits me, it just makes me nauseous. One time during a bus ride, it suddenly hit me, and I felt like I was going to puke. I asked the bus driver if I could open the window for fresh air, and he wouldn't let me. I got through the drive just fine, though it was still really weird.

I think what started it on the bus was part of my shoes. I was sitting with one leg on my knee, and part of that shoe was this opaque orange-ish thing with a plastic-y shoe smell.

Second one. This is less a physical object, as far as I know, and more of a...movement, I guess? I *really* can't describe this one accurately without having it hit me, but basically, try moving just your big toe, and none of your other toes. Make the movement quick and snappy, too. If that's too difficult, try your thumb. But it's a lot *shorter* of a movement, if that makes sense. Whatever it is, it's about the size of my big toe, but it feels like it's a quicker, snappier movement, as if what's being moved is *shorter* than the toe itself. I'm sorry I can't really describe this one well.

Has anyone heard of something like this before? Part of me wants to figure out what this is, but there's always this weird sort of dread when it comes to these sensations, like I don't *want* to know what it was.

* cleaning and hand washing (I do so often like I mentioned before)
* checking – such as checking doors are locked or that the gas is off
* asking for reassurance
* repeating words in their head
* thinking ""neutralising"" thoughts to counter the obsessive thoughts

This has been heavily bothering me. For example 1 of the worst ways it effects me is everytime I find something I enjoy for example a show I like I feel I need to know %100 percent if the show is good or I am just weird and I watch so many Youtube videos and why it is or why it isnt and I obses over it. I get this weird stress feeling about the new intreset and try to do everything I can to make sure I am right why its good and show my friends and see if they like it too. I would always ask if they like it continually and even if they say its good I still feel panicked that they say might not. This is very difficult for me to describe its just a majoir stress feeling added with an obsession I get shortly after finding this new interest or show or game. On top of that I get extremely anxious daily and I have talked to counselors (not about OCD just anxiety in general) and its more than the average person and this anxious feeling almost never leaves it just gets a bit better at times and I can have a full on panic attack just over this anxiety sometimes I wont even know why, I have heard that increased anxiety is also a sign of OCD but I am not sure. (also sorry for lack of like punctuation and maybe sounding completely incoherent) Talking about the over obsessiveness again it is really starting to wear me down and its becoming increasingly more unlivable to the point where I can't enjoy things. This happens also not only once for each new interest ETC for example if I find a new show I like I can watch it the first time a day or two later after finishing it I get my obsessive thing back and it usually lasts for a couple weeks of constantly obssesing over it. And then I eventually move on but after that if I ever watch it again or even just watch a video about it boom its back again. Also I feel the need to do everything in my power to try to make myself not be a failure no matter how many times I ask my parents and they say they are proud of me (I get good grades, I am learning a new language). I feel I have to do this and that so then I can be a good person. I get I am probably stupid for not really talking about this but then again I am dumb and maybe this is normal???? but yeah should I talk to a doctor about this lmao? Thanks

Hello everyone. Searching for a advice,1,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Hello to evy

Hello everyone.
I have quite an interesting situation, and although I know this isn't the most suitable place to find answers or solutions, still it's possible that some response might help me enormously, more than you can imagine.
I'm a 22-year-old guy, living alone. For over 8 years, I've been periodically experiencing depressive episodes lasting from 3 to 14 months with varying severity.
I've seen many specialists, specifically 4 who evaluated me, diagnosed me with moderate to severe depression, and offered various methods of medication treatment (SSRIs/SNRIs/tricyclic antidepressants), which I strictly followed for extended periods (4-5 months) but proved to be totally ineffective.
Usually, these episodes creep in so gradually that you don't even notice how one day you wake up totally devoid of energy and will. And similarly gradually, they recede.
I find myself now at a point where I'm struggling greatly to write these lines because I feel totally drained of any mental strength, my thoughts are sluggish and forced, and I struggle to articulate what exactly is happening to me.
I would appreciate it if someone who has some idea of what I might be suffering from could at least offer a guess, their own hypothesis, because I feel like I'm treading water, following the same paths to resolve my situation.
I say ""guesses"" because I'm not even convinced myself that I suffer from depression, but that's what the ""specialists"" have told me.
If you ask me why I don't go to a psychologist or psychiatrist, I'll tell you that I'm totally broke, living off some savings, and I haven't been working for 2 weeks now, I can't find the strength. On the other hand, I've been to specialists before and it all boils down again to the same pills that don't show their effect and make me even more lifeless.
I'll list the symptoms I'm experiencing:
- Constant physical fatigue
- Mental fatigue (everything requires forced effort, the same activities meant to bring you pleasure seem torturous)
- My working memory has dropped drastically, as has my long-term memory. The information in my head seems hard to access and hard to retrieve; I can spend 10 minutes trying to remember what I did 5 hours ago.
- My thinking seems super slow and forced, my automatic thoughts have disappeared, or free associations. Sometimes I notice that my head is empty, devoid of thoughts; in general, I feel like I'm a retarded degenerate.
- I find practically no pleasure in anything
- I have a constant feeling of frustration as if it's too cold, too hot, or too tired, meaning I can't even properly enjoy rest or feel it.
- From the range of emotions, only anger remains, which gives me a mental energy boost to combat apathy and not be crushed by the situation.
That being said, you would do me an immeasurable favor if you could give me some advice on what I might be suffering from and what I could do in this situation.
If you want to recommend lifestyle advice, know that I strictly adhere to:
8 hours of sleep, I take cold showers 1-2 times a day, I do at least 3 hours of physical activity per day (even if I don't feel like it), I don't consume alcohol or other nonsense, and I try to eat because I don't really have an appetite.
I have no relatives except for a brother who is living in another country.

I’m a 25 year old male from Australia, I had a fairly traumatic childhood and have smoked cannabis on and off between the ages of 13-24 


August the 14th 2022 was just a normal day, I woke up early, had a coffee, while I checked social media, planned the day & got into some activewear. I then had high caffeinated pre-workout, did a workout and then walked my dog, after that I had my post workout meal and went into my room to smoke bongs of very strong cannabis as all of that had been my morning routine for quite a while, I was also vaping nicotine vapes flat out throughout the day also

I pretty much just did a few things around the house, then got ready to go to work managing a hospitality store for the night. I got home at about 9pm, had a shower, chopped up some weed to smoke & put a movie on. I realised I had a couple canisters of nitrous oxide under my bed that my girlfriend brought over, so I decided to just have a little bit (I never did this really, so just letting everybody know that this was a very rare occurrence) I kept smoking weed after I did the nitrous oxide, and for the rest of the evening everything felt pretty normal just super stoned as usual

Ivy League Psychologists Reveal The #1 Secret To Beat Depression,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"In my attempt to find the quickest ways to deal with depression naturally... I've come across lots of stuff. Eat more vegetables, exercise, be around people, think positively, go to therapy... the list goes on and on.

But that's a long laundry list, enough to make anyone tired just thinking about it all.

At this point, I look for what has the best results and is also the quickest and simplest.

I figure other people want that too. 

So I wrote an article on some studies I found... research from University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and Columbia. 

And there's ONE thing that has the biggest impact on your mood... which most of us tend to shrug off.

Partially because our culture acts like it's not a big deal.

And also because a lot of depressed people struggle with it, so they think there's not much that can be done to improve it.

The #1 thing is getting enough good quality sleep.

There's plenty of research to back it up, too. [You can read more about it in my article here.](https://medium.com/@depressedamerican/ivy-league-psychologists-reveal-the-1-secret-to-beat-depression-ce086246600f)

You may be saying ""that's great lady, but I'm an insomniac... can't ever sleep...""

I hear ya! Me too friend, me too. 

That's why I've also researched how to fall asleep in 60 seconds or less. Luckily, the same techniques that help you fall asleep in mere minutes also calm your anxiety and rumination... which are all linked to depression too. 

Like I said, I'm here for a good time not a long time. I do not want to be trying every method out there proven to help depression. I go for the high leverage activities - best results with fewest consequences, side effects, or time spent!

So there are lots of wins if you get your sleep under control.

Mental health is the kind of different emotions or feelings a person experiences mentally. It includes the positive and negative emotions of a person as theses are the two sides of a coin in life. Life is full of ups and downs. As we grow older, we learn to cope up with the problems and make a solution out of it. But it doesn’t mean that we are mentally healthy. Mentally healthy people are those who are able to handle the problems of life and overcome them. If you want to be mentally healthy then you should learn to control your emotions and make good out of bad. You should not attach yourself too much with the materialistic aspects of life. Being emotionally healthy is more important than being mentally healthy. You must keep yourself emotionally healthy so that you can overcome the problems of life with ease. To keep mentally healthy it is important to distinguish between a problem and a crisis. So the better option to keep mind relaxed is to do yoga or medications .It can bring changes to our life.

To make an extremely long novel short, it wasn’t until April of last year when everything sorta fell apart and it hasn’t gotten better. One day my mom left me a voicemail of her shrieking and screaming she was dying that saw me crippling with fear and rushing from one city to the next in an Uber to make sure she was alive. It was constant hospital visits after hospitals visits, missing work, her guilting me (and my siblings making me feel as if I’m the one who is her sole guardian - even though I’m the youngest).

I’m a disabled retired veteran, I started playing guitar after I was wheelchair bound and it was the best therapy I had access to after coming back from an intensive unit. I got so well rounded at playing I went to school at Berkeley college of music for a few a course and really excelled, I got a band together and kept at it even tho I wanted to do more cover music we would end up in a jam and I couldn’t teach the bass player because he would always say he knows what he’s doing and I am really just wanting to play and have people get excited from all the dynamic and pick ups and bring downs and reprise’s, ect. It was really fun but I got depressed and started going less till it was just the guys banging around and I’m really trying to take things seriously instead of just jamming in E or jamming in D, I really tryed making my own thing alone but I need a drummer and a bass and if I could find a keyboard/piano playing I could have a album recorded in 2 weeks at max. I just have no type of connections in Pasco and because disabled is very hard for me to get around and do things.. I only write in here because I’m afraid of going in front of people on a limb but if I had trust in the people I play with that we can pull this off fine because we have done it would make me feel otherwise and I can’t seem to find anyone around that wants to or can play jam/improv music near me. I’m nervous but mainly insecure about playing when I literally know all my modes with my eyes closed and house to use them in improv, my time is great and I know my tone is very very good..

Her demeanor has changed a lot around me, with her being more open in body language and how she talks to me now vs. with other people I see her with, she's generally quieter. She was a different person almost when we first met.

I've read little things: blushing, eye contact changes, quick glances from afar, and her always trying to be the one to set me up or just finding a reason to come talk, etc. I really want to be able to talk to her more personally and start a text conversation maybe, which I think she'd like due to being an introvert/shy myself and knowing texting is easier.

What mental illness is this and how to deal with this?,0,True,False,True,False,1,False,"A really close friend of mine has been behaving very secretive and dishonest. When caught, they say they are hiding things because they think I copy them and their hobbies. They will say this about the smallest, most inconspicuous things like if I happen to wear the colour blue a few days after them, they’ll say I did it because of them and they’ll get upset with me for not admitting that I did it because of them. But how can I admit something that’s not true? This is just a small example. They will do this with just about everything and they’ll hide things from me so I can’t copy them. 

For example, I recently enrolled in French lessons and this person and I both always had a vague interest in French, we’d often talk about it. When I told them I’m taking French, they admitted they had been secretly taking French for a while but hid it from me because they thought I would copy them and become competitive. They even believe that I don’t genuinely want to learn French, I only picked it up because I somehow found out that they were taking lessons while they were actively hiding it from me! How does that even make sense? How can I copy something I had no idea about?

Anyway, our relationship is becoming more and more toxic because of all this. I can’t do anything without them trying to belittle my interests and trying to convince me that I’m inauthentic and everything I do is a fake impersonation of them.

I genuinely believe this is a mental illness, does anyone have an idea what it is? I’ve asked them to go to a therapist but they refuse and tell me to go to one because I’m the “mentally ill person copying them”.(they know I already go to a therapist for my own reasons)

Baby died at 3 weeks old to congenital heart defect ,6,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Hi everyone. I found out last year at 22 weeks pregnant that my daughter had a congenital heart defect called HLHS. She basically only had half a heart. She had additional factors that made her condition extremely serious and I spent the four months leading up to her birth with horrible anxiety and anticipation of what was to come. She was born in August and lived for 23 days. In that time, she had an emergency heart cath immediately at birth, open heart surgery, placed on ECMO for 10 days, and ultimately died because her lungs and heart were too weak. 

She was my 5th child. I have 3 living children and lost another baby due to a second trimester miscarriage in 2019 that I almost hemorrhaged from. 

All this being said, my anxiety is through the roof since losing my daughter. Particularly with health related things. I was seeing a therapist for awhile who said she believes I have a form of PTSD from everything we experienced during my daughter’s short life.

Rise with the Sun - The Early Bird's Secret,6,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Have you ever noticed how peaceful the morning is, just as the sun rises? This is the perfect time for you to start your day. Waking up early is more than just an old saying; it's a key to success. When you rise with the sun, you get a head start while the rest of the world is still asleep. It's quiet, peaceful, and the best time to focus on yourself.

But I know what you're thinking: 'Waking up early is hard.' Yes, it is. But remember, the best things in life don't come easy. Waking up early gives you extra hours to do something meaningful. Whether it's exercising, reading, or planning your day, these extra hours are yours to use without distractions.

And here's a little secret: the most successful people are early risers.

They understand that the early morning is a golden time for productivity and self-improvement. By waking up early, you set a positive tone for the rest of your day. You feel more in control and ready to take on whatever comes your way.

So, challenge yourself to wake up with the first rays of sunlight. It might be tough at first, but stick with it, and soon you'll see a big difference in your life. You'll be more productive, focused, and ready to turn your goals into reality.""

I have to work close to home because the vehicle I drive is a beater. (I let my wife drive my fully loaded SUV I make payments on) because it’s the family car. Yet she also works 5 minutes from our shitty house. 

I feel like I live in the shadow of my wife’s ex. She has two kids with two different men. Her oldest dad isn’t in the picture as he’s a deadbeat addict and criminal. Her youngest’s dad was the man of the family. He was a great dad but a shit partner. My wife left him, and pretty soon after aggressively went after me. (We worked together) he’s since passed. So me and my wife are all these kids have… and I don’t know how to be a dad. I’ve always had trouble connecting to people, kids especially. I’m not energetic or fun. I do however support them in any way that I can. I watch them most of the time because my wife works 2nd shift and I work 1st. They are very indifferent towards me. The oldest even goes out of her way to say things like “I forgot about you” at the holidays, anytime I go to school events or anything like that. I feel like the kids think I broke up their family. My wife always refers to her ex as “My kids dad” even on social media, in posts and stuff, because in all honesty he was. It just makes me feel like an outsider in “our home” which is the same house she and the ex shared. 

My wife is a terrible parent. (She’s exactly as good as she knows how to be) Her kids have absolutely no structure, no respect, no accountability and honestly almost no redeeming qualities. The youngest is your typical iPad kid (7F) she has no patience of any kind. Probably undiagnosed ADHD, and is completely spoiled rotten. My wife is a recovering alcoholic and made up for not being present with material things. To her credit she is pretty smart and does great in school. I try to provide the structure and accountability she’s never had, but she hates me for it. 

The oldest is a little delinquent. (11F) she’s gotten in fights, stolen from other kids at school, has no respect for adults or authority. Intentionally says the most hurtful things to anyone around anytime she doesn’t get her way or is criticized in anyway. I’m afraid she’s going to grow up to be a criminal, or similar type of degenerate. I try really hard with her because I was similarly angry and hurt growing up, so I understand where she’s coming from. Sometimes leveling with her works, usually it doesn’t and she just acts like you’re not worth even breathing the same oxygen as her. 

We are in a crippling amount of debt, which my wife refuses to file bankruptcy on, because it will tank our credit. (We were both over 700 pre 2021) I got sick and couldn’t work for a while and trying to survive on one income destroyed us financially. 

My wife doesn’t treat me like a priority or really act like she wants anything to do with me. I’m very much in love with her. She has a lot of good traits, intangible qualities of being a great person. She’s just been through so much and trying to rebuild her life sober is proving more of a challenge than I think she was prepared for. She has tons of baggage from mental health issues, to family issues. It’s a lot to try to juggle. I have expressed many times that I could use attention / affection. Really it’s the only thing I crave. I do so much to try to support her, the kids and trying to stay positive and strong while we rebuild. 

She chalks a lot of it up to her mental health. I understand. I’ve had many low points in life. 

I’ve never felt as much like giving up as I do now. I’m struggling every day to keep going.

Is bipolar rage just common or is it supposed to happen? Because my friend doesn't really experience it despite being diagnosed.,0,False,False,True,False,10,False," I have multiple friends struggling with mental health - in real life and online. One of them has been diagnosed with Bipolar II quite some time ago, when he was fairly young. In spite all of the stigma he had to face, he's one of the kindest people I know.

Now, to the question. He has been feeling very insecure over being ""too  aggressive"" lately. What does he mean by that? He means that, when someone's cruel to him, he tells them in a slightly raised voice to shut up before leaving... Yup. That's the extent of his aggression. When he's mad in a depressive episode, he merely cries; when not experiencing either, he expresses anger very calmly; when in mania, he might raise his voice a little, but he never hit anybody or destroyed anything, nor was he that loud - and it was always something reasonable he was mad at.  Truthfully, the most raging I've ever seen him was when the abuser of a friend got away with their crime with only having to pay a fairly small amount of money. And even there, he was calmer than me - anger wise, at least.

Generally, during mania - or rather hypomania - he told me about not really feeling happy, but more anxious, nauseous, dizzy, he can't sleep nor eat  properly, he keeps hyperventilating. The mere positives are that he has  higher levels of energy, he can enjoy things slightly better than  usual, and he gets more creative. That's it. What I've noticed besides that is that he gets slightly more childish and spends more money than he usually does (never too much, but definitely more).

I've noticed myself that there's no difference between how quickly he gets angry in either or neither episode, just the extent in how he expresses  it (crying, calm anger, more openly showing that he's angry). Yet, he thinks his REASONABLE anger during mania must be ""bipolar rage"". I mean, given how calm and hardly angry his siblings are, maybe he is the most vocal about it - but that's nothing compared to what the internet describes as bipolar rage! Can that happen? I know the internet describes mania/hypomania as something too positive at times, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is just something similar. Is bipolar rage a must or is it merely common? Because his rage really doesn't feel  like what the internet puts onto it.

(I'm adding this because it might be important. I met him in a support group regarding toxic upbringings. His brother and him experience stuff like flashbacks, nightmares, and they get triggered when reminded of something related to their past, so maybe they have PTSD - though, it never was diagnosed. His brother and him generally appear sensitive (even to stuff unrelated to their personal trauma) and empathic. While there is a difference between how he expresses his empathy and how far it goes, he does still empathize a lot in either or neither episode.)

Time to add my effexor back?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Ok so around October I got off of suboxone after being it for about 8 years, taking 2-3 8mg strips a day. I tapered for about a month, if that, from one strip/day to 1/8th if a strip for my last 5 days or so. I tapered too quickly but I made it through. Once I hit 2 weeks off though, the depression hit REALLY bad and I quit subs once in the past only for a month maybe but what helped me quit and take those effects ya away, give me energy, be a mood booster, take away any lingering withdrawal symptoms, etc, but still not feel high. I didn’t detox last time I quit the kratom (but I also just got right back on the subs) So I had experience with it. After about 3 months on the kratom I tried to begin tapering to get off that because I noticed detox symptoms if I didn’t have it. I tried for 3 months unsuccessfully. It would literally be the difference of one capsule that I would feel ok and able to function from being unable to work, function, socialize and curled up in a ball detoxing, literally within 12 hours of my last dose, feeling like I’m at the peak of my WD. So I was off subs for about 6 months at that point and I just couldn’t get off the kratom. I got a month script of subs and have been taking half strip/  day at first, I’m now down to an 8th of a strip with half a strip left, which I plan on taking in 1/16ths.

How many of you identify with being a sensitive person?,8,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I'm curious. Because I definitely am a highly sensitive person, part of the 15-20% of people more genetically sensitive. Elaine Aron's book has been super helpful in understanding more about this aspect of myself.

It explains why I developed SAD whereas my 3 brothers didn't. I was sensitive, they weren't. Experiences in life affected me more. And as a result, I believe it was a lot easier to take on core wounds, feelings of rejection, which ultimately spread like a plague when I became a teenager - made me so avoidant of people and forming close relationships.

And from there, it just grew.

I honestly believe I would have been fine as a sensitive person. I just didn't get the right experiences to build a positive attachment to people at an early age. My high sensitivity demanded a careful building of a positive sense of self which I didn't really get because of an extremely demanding and overbearing mother who didn't allow my own natural personality to take its course.

I had to conform to hers.

Which leads to so many of the problems - fears - I had of people later on. I was so worried about meeting their approval because my own sense of self was only granted when they were happy and liked my behavior.

Reusable makeup remover pads. I use 3-5 cotton balls today and buy a bag for $2 every two months. Got a pack of 30 reusable, washable, makeup remover rounds for $6. 

Ordered a back sleeping pillow to help cut down on the eye wrinkles I’m getting.

How do I get rid of the feeling of emptiness in my life? (My evolution from atheist to agnostic),2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi. I am 20 years old. I am 20 years old and I first started questioning when I was 13 years old. I accepted atheism between the ages of 13 and 15. But at the age of 15, I had a crisis of identity, if that's the right term, and I believed that I would never know the right answer to these issues. Because at the time I adopted atheism, I think I was no different from a theist.

Before I was accepting something I wasn't sure about, and after I was rejecting something I wasn't sure about. So since the age of 15 I've been under the umbrella of agnosticism. Theist agnostic, atheist agnostic... That's it.

With the emotional changes of teenage years, I started to think about death. I tried taking pills a few times, but without serious consequences, because I seemed to want to know what death was like more than I really wanted to die. The last time I took pills, I thought it was a very painful experience and I didn't try it again. 

When I started high school, I had a conversation with a friend of mine and he said something like ""just in case, I think you should accept the existence of a god. At least you'll have a chance to go to heaven"" or something like that. I agreed with my friend's opinion at some point, and this brought me closer to the idea of agnosticism. By the way, at that time, in 9th grade, my parents found my virtual diary where I wrote all my inner thoughts and managed to read it. They said they were going to take me to a psychologist, but I somehow convinced them because I didn't want to talk to anyone. By the way, my parents are Muslim. I tried to pretend that I was what they wanted me to be, otherwise they wouldn't leave me alone. They would constantly try to change my thoughts. Until then I considered myself an atheist, but in time I decided that I was agnostic because I didn't know what was true and what wasn't. Now I am on good terms with my family and they think I am Muslim. Because even if I say that I am not, they will not accept it. 

I don't know whether it was because I was thinking too much or because I was a quiet introvert, I started to experience derealization. At one point I felt it so strongly that I thought, ""I think God is punishing me by making me doubt my own reality because I denied God's reality"". When I was walking down the road, I had no problems and suddenly my surroundings seemed unreal. It wasn't something that happened all the time, but I still experienced it from time to time. Eventually I realized that the more I kept it in my mind, the more often I would experience it. That's what derealization was like for me. It was both enjoyable and disturbing at the same time.

Now I live less frequently than before, and occasionally when I feel bad I pray with my mother, hoping that maybe it will help. (by the way, I haven't prayed for a while, for months).

When I started university, I started to worry about dying without my family and about finding a job in the future. I had crying spells, a feeling of emptiness and I was overly dependent on my mother because I was afraid of dying alone and I was afraid of death because time was passing so fast and I didn't understand anything. I was afraid of being alone if I lost my family who had taken care of me all my life. So whenever I felt stuck, I started to think about the possibility of dying with my family. If we all died together, it would be a little less scary. So whenever I felt stuck I took refuge in this thought. It is uncertain when death will come and I am afraid of getting old and seeing the people I love die. When our teacher in high school said that atheism and agnosticism can lead to a feeling of emptiness, it didn't make sense to me, but I know I have experienced it.

I don't know how far it will go like this, but in general, every psychological distress I have always lies under this religious, philosophical thought or whatever it is. And I can't even explain it to my family. Maybe one day it would be good to get psychological support, but I don't know if I can find a solution. Have any of you experienced such a situation before? If so, I would appreciate if you share your thoughts.

I cannot focus and achieve/study,1,False,False,True,False,2,False," Hi, this might seem like a rant. But recently (this whole semester has been feeling like a fever dream). I gained like 20ish lbs and have been feeling quite depressed even in happy moments of my life. Every morning I wake up, I am frustrated that I have to start another day.

I have been doing pretty well in my first year at uni grade-wise (my mental health in first year was shit and I was struggling with sleep and got diagnosed with anxiety disorder). I was receiving small scholarships, getting lab opportunities and feeling proud of myself for getting ahead. I am in my second year now, my first-semester grade had been great (4.0 GPA and the averages for those classes are all low 70 ish with over 200 people). But the second semester, I am not feeling myself (depressed, skin breaking out, not working out enough, also got a little kitten whos a lot of work) and I am doing below my expectations for quite a few exams. I feel like I am being too hard on myself because I constantly feel disgusted by my unmotivated self, but I am TERRIFIED of taking exams now because I have been doing really terrible on exams (self-sabotaging during exams) and I am overplaying everything in my head. I am extremely self-aware of my issues and know I need to stop but I just can't.

I have dreams that NEED at least a PhD degree and I am already tired during my undergrad? I will be starting a summer job working in an amazing lab but I am scared I will be incompetent and I totally lack confidence in myself (the other hired summer student is super amazing at what he does).

I am just so sick and tired of myself. Sometimes I can't help but slap myself when I am studying and have self-harm thoughts. I am constantly complaining about my marks to the point where my friends are a little bit upset by them. Yes, school is a major issue because of the exam confidence I've lost, but I am more disgusted with my current state rn (overweight, greasy hair, total lack of confidence, complaining all the time and shitty exam performance).

Yes, I do base my identity on my grade because it has A LOT OF impact on my chosen career. Also, it is an amazing confidence booster when u do better than everyone else.

I know this should not be a Reddit sub where people label and diagnose each other. I will talk to a professional and I have a therapist, but I want to gain some perspective, so I appreciate your guessing/diagnosis from afar.

I cannot sleep at night because the moment the light turns off I imagine someone is in my room wanting to kill me. I don't dare do close my eyes, if I do, the second before I fall asleep, I have to check my environment.

Also, when I go to the toilet I imagine horrific scenarios happening to me.

Basically, all those fears that children have about monsters under their beds, are just more intense. I never know if I will be scared at night or not - never. I cannot plan my day, I never know if I can finish my homework or if I will be able to visit all my lectures. Zero control over my life because my quality and quantity of sleep seem random to me.

Basically, somebody told me that ""not being able to sleep because you imagine someone is in your room to kill you"" is a typical sign of PTSD or CPTSD, is that true? I googled a lot about PTSD and I thought since I don't remember a major event in my life, the PTSD ""profile"" doesn't apply to me.

my main issues are that i am a control freak and that i get angry when i am stressed. i have been working on my mental health for about 14 months now with drastic improvements. but i still get snappy.

his issues are that he is very disorganized and forgetful.

it puts us in a position where i have to be in charge of everything that has to do with organization, dead lines, time and finances.

i think i get resentful and take it out on him throughout the day.

please understand though, i try to mitigate where i can. i send gentle text reminders, i ask nice, i forgive him when hes late, i forgive him for forgetting payments even when we get stuck with late fees we cant afford, i try to motivate, i make lists, i set out boxes for him, i put things right in front of him, i keep his things in the same places as much as possible, i keep a calandar with all of our important stuff, im even having to delegate the time he spends with his daughter so that she is actually getting to see him when she visits (im the stepmom). he forgets everything no matter what.

i want to stop being mean and stop resenting him but he is causing me to become even more of a control freak because everything is out of control. i literally have no idea how to help him. were too broke for a doctor. i wanna be nicer to him but he makes it hard.

ive expressed all of this to him by the way. he just says he knows. he says he wishes he wasnt like this. but then nothing changes. 

this isnt loving him for who he is kinda thing either this is about the fact that if i stop doing the things im doing everything will go up in flames. i feel like i am doing everything i can for his adhd. i gotta figure out how to be nicer bc i dont think he can change. i gotta figure out how not to resent this man because i do love him. i dont want him to change who he is but living the way we do is unsustainable. its affecting our finances and relationship. 

he is mad because i am a control freak. if i stop nothing will get done tho. i have to stop being so resentful so i stop making hurtful comments. its just that it all started out nice. being nice now is so hard when his forgetfullness has put our house on the line. im at my wits end. i love him so much tho. i dont know how to be any more supportive nothing works. being nice and motivating just gets me stepped on he doesnt take stuff serious. hell only do stuff if he thinks hes in trouble.

Self harm: how to get better?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I'm in my 40s, happily single parent, and struggling with intense anxiety despite meds (ssri) and weekly counseling. I've tried emdr and really didn't like it though I am going to give it another go.

Biggest sources of anxiety are my job (teacher and it is not a good fit for me) and family stress caused by my older brother bullying me since childhood. The bullying has continued although he is nearing 50. He joined several foster parent groups (he is not a foster parent, I am both a foster and adoptive parent) and bashed my parenting ability and status as a single parent. The bashing was pretty bad--he created aliases to do this and he vehemently denies it. I can stay away from him because he lives out of town but my parents seem to be pushing us to be closer together.

I have been a self mutilator since age 7. Specifically, I punch my legs, bite my hands when in the ""red zone"" of frustration or anger. Nothing seems to help. I've tried all the ideas and suggestions out there on the internet. I'm afraid to admit the self mutilation to my counselor as I worry that it would affect my status as a foster and adoptive parent.

Any suggestions? I am working on finding a more suitable job, but the family situation really sucks. Parents are old school and just want us to get along. The only thing I can think of is severely limiting the time with them. I wish I didn't take the anger out on myself. Even if my brother or parent are being obvious a-holes, I blame myself.

If this is you then get off this sub!,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Hi. I struggle with ptsd, second hand trauma, anxiety, and depression with suicidal thoughts. I had been particularly hurting a lot this last week and decided to join this group just to see if anyone else was struggling with something like me. I don’t feel comfortable enough yet to go into details mostly because one of the biggest triggers for me is thinking back to the things that started this all. I get lost in my head and I’d rather just try to not think about it so I’ve been very subtle in my posts. The other day I made a post and someone actually had the audacity to tell me that I don’t have ptsd and I’m just sad and trying to get attention. I told him to tell that to my therapist. And he went on another one of my post and told me “again this isn’t ptsd, get off this redit” now I’m not usually offended by dumb people but I came here to try and have a safe place. Just like most of the people on here. Now I know I have ptsd. Maybe it’s unique but I already have doubted it myself enough. It’s been a long hard last few years for me. Most of the people on here understand but some apparently don’t do let me put it simple for you. It doesn’t matter if it’s a 12 year old girl who’s boyfriend just broke up with her you don’t bash anyone for being hurt even if they are on here claiming they have ptsd there’s much nicer ways of treating people. Read a post earlier about someone saying they think they might have ptsd and after describing his pain it didn’t really sound like ptsd but they where obviously still struggling and most of the comments where very supportive either way.

how can i deal with grief?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"i (17m) lost my grandma a little over two weeks ago. i haven’t been the same ever since, and the funeral is tomorrow.

me and my grandma were really close ever since i was born -which was on her birthday- and she was always the one i could rely on. she suffered from cancer for the past two years, and her condition only got worse since last august. i tried to visit her as much as i could, but as selfish i was, as worse her health became, i was afraid to meet her and face the truth that her health was going downhill. she was hospitalised, but my parents didn’t really let me visit her there, since she got so sick, they didn’t know how i would react. nevertheless, as soon as i heard that she didn’t have a month left to live, i visited her asap. when i saw her there, she wasn’t the woman, who i knew since i was born.. a week after that, she sadly passed away.

i just have no idea how i’m supposed to deal with this whole situation right now and i’m kind of lost. i feel helpless, i haven’t slept normally since she passed, and the worst thing is, that i have the same thumb as she had, so i’m constantly reminded when i look at my hands.

i have never lost anyone this close in my life. i am also suffering from bpd and depression, so i’m also on meds and stuff, so this isn’t something i feel like i’m strong enough for. i feel like my mental health decreased a lot, and i can’t feel happy without the constant guilt of “i’m supposed to be crying home, alone right now”. some family problem has also happened, which led me to having panic attacks, that i didn’t have until now…

can anyone give me any advice that could help me just accept the thought of death and loss? how am i supposed to take care of myself in this situation?

I just really need some support.,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"F(22) 

So I have bpd, anxiety, depression, mood instability and some physical health issues. this causes me to be extremely tired and drained emotionally, socially, and physically, pretty much 24/7. I have been dealing with this my entire life. it’s gotten to a point where I have lost/pushed away all of my support and I am extremely numb. I have zero friends. legitimately none. I enjoy solitude; and i’m proud for standing up to myself and removing the toxic ppl from my life. but now I find myself not only in the deepest and longest  depressive episode i’ve ever felt, but just plain sad. like i’m in constant mourning of my old life. they sucked and they weren’t the best, but I had friends to vent to about my days and everything I was feeling. 

i’m starting cosmetology school tomorrow, and everytime someone asks “ARENT U SOOOOO EXCITED ??!!!!😆😆” I choke back my anger and reply with a “yes.” but the truth is, I feel nothing. if anything, I feel terrified this is another failed attempt at school(i’ve withdrawn from regular university 3 times now). I don’t believe in myself. I physically cannot get excited, and it makes me sad. I realized it’s easy to be excited and eager or even nervous when u have a friend to go through it with u, telling u it will be okay, or laughing about the things that go wrong, or just being there for you. I don’t have that anymore. 

I guess i’m really just asking—ik it’s stupid—if anyone can just help me be happy for myself. even just for tonight. I’m so tired of these emotional mental blocks I have installed, whether from my trauma or the meds i’m on, thwarting any joy or feelings. i’m sad. i’m lonely. i’ve given up on myself mentally. I live in the city and struggle with money, so i’m constantly stressed. it sucks bc I KNOW my condition would improve if I could just make friends, have some support, but i’m really worried I don’t care to anymore. if anyone can cheer me on from across the internet though, I think I might be able to muster up a bit of excitement.

I (22M) have been going through a tough time these past few months. I’ve noticed symptoms that would indicate I was depressed but never really considered the fact I could be depressed until a few months ago. 

Let me start by saying I was never really one of the popular kids and never really one of the kids that were bullied growing up, but I fell into the category of just kind of being there. That’s kind of how I have felt my entire time through school. I would try and fit into social settings and didn’t really have a tough time finding people to hang out with due to sports and other activities but it always felt like I was just there, I wasn’t wanted there but they could tolerate me for periods of time. So throughout school have accumulated a fair bit of acquaintances, but none that I would consider my close friends. So, I rarely ever get texts from other people asking what I am doing or even how I’m doing, and this has really been weighing on me.

I fell like no one wants to be around me ever and it really sucks. I honestly fell like if I were to drop off the face of the earth there would be 3-4 people outside my direct family that would actually care I was missing. And I know 3-4 people might seem like a lot and I know having a family that loves me is more than some people have but I don’t know how to ask for help.

Currently everyone is on Spring Break and no one texted me they had plans. I know I could have asked, but  my anxiety about being the unwanted member wouldn’t let me “barge into their vacation” is how I essentially saw it, and I feared if I did go I would be the one they left everywhere and didn’t inform what they were doing. I’m tired of being the one to reach out all the time. If they wanted me there they would have talked to me about it right? So now I’ve just been sitting in bed the last few days thinking why am I always the afterthought, why don’t they want me around, why am I such a loser, and if I were to die I wouldn’t really care that much anymore because most of the people I thought were my “friend” don’t actually care for or about me.

PS: I wouldn’t commit. I’m too much of a pussy to firstly, and secondly I couldn’t do that to my family. However I really don’t know who to reach out to for help. My mom would worry too much and same with my dad. I don’t even know how to bring up this topic with them, I don’t want them to worry but man do I feel like shit.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41518,New,2023,3,Very low,0,47,2606,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0

Struggling to get over the fact that my girlfriend smokes weed.,0,False,False,True,False,34,False,"Hi all, going to have a bit of a vulnerable moment so I would appreciate if people would attempt to understand where I am coming from. Call this immature if you want, but just know I am trying to do my best to understand this and realize where my anxiety is stemming from.

&#x200B;

My new girlfriend of just a couple months smokes weed. She smokes joints, bongs, bowls, edibles, the whole thing. I have always thought smoking weed was disgusting, smoking anything in general always grossed me out. I have always said this would be a dealbreaker. I didn't know she smoked until a little while into us talking, I had already grown feelings for her and I had thought maybe this was something I could over look. My dad always smoked cigarettes as a kid and I have always thought it was the most disgusting thing and it was something I couldn't wait to get away from when moving away for school. 

My anxiety is constant, overwhelming, physical, etc. When I get anxious it can be for no reason, and I will feel hot, dizzy, have no appetite or motivation. It is very debilitating and something I have had for my entire life. It comes on suddenly, and sometimes hangs around for literally weeks. 

My girlfriend has told me she smokes with her friends, sometimes she hotboxes a car, or goes to some park to do it. 

I have such a bad connotation of her being the teenager or young adult sitting in the dark park at night or in the creepy car wreaking of weed. It just rubs me the wrong way and without trying to insult anybody, I just associate it with a certain type of person and its not the person I see her as or as I would want to see my significant other. 

However, I want to also try and put into perspective the other side of things as well and try to look at the benefits/the reasonable view of things which I will write below:

\- She is doing it hardly ever and only when shes home from college (over the summer with friends)

\- She goes about it in a safe way, she doesnt smoke at college parties or take joints from people she doesnt know

\- She is 20 and experimenting and having fun. Shes not necessarily doing anything wrong.

\- Lowkey science wise, smoking isnt even as bad for you as alcohol and I drink alcohol myself so I feel like a hypocrite telling her not to smoke.

\- I have asked her not to get crossed and not to ever get in/or drive a car with someone who is  impaired or if she is impaired and she has promised me she wont do either.

On the other hand, I really just think its disgusting and I have such a negative connotation with it that I am trying to change.

When to disclose mental health issues when dating?,4,True,False,True,False,2,False,"Hey everyone!

So let me give you my background. I am a 23f. I previously dated a man from 15-20 who severely sexually abused me. We ended up staying neighbors from 20-23 because I was stuck in this cycle of not wanting to give up my only support system. He was my best friend aside from the abuse I had endured which he is very regretful and remorseful about, truly. But I made it clear I would never put myself back in that situation even though I know we have made massive improvements.

I have been going to therapy on and off since when I was 18. I finally got serious and was going to therapy for the last three years once a week until I lost my insurance. I am working on getting good insurance and starting a new job soon so hopefully, in two months I will be able to resume.

I work in the mental health field and have a mental health degree so I am very self-aware and have a pretty decent support system.

I have started looking at seriously dating again but am at a loss for how and when to disclose this information. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety-induced depression at 18. I have taken meds for these and have changed my lifestyle to try and prevent falling into bouts of depression and becoming overly anxious.

I also have Complex PTSD from the previous relationship which does affect me severely. It used to be so bad that I would have night terrors and I tried to manage it with medication but there was not much they could do. I tried several medications, one worked really well at making me stop dreaming but then eventually stopped working and I could no longer go up anymore on it. I have tried others that did not take away the nightmares but just made me sleep through them and be unable to wake up from them when they got really bad. My psychiatrist and therapist told me that there wasn't much we could do besides wait for them to stop because they would stop eventually. Which they did for the most part.

The sleep deprivation from that 6 month period of being afraid to go to sleep led me to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder around age 20. I have tried several medications for bipolar disorder but all of them ended up making me extremely tired and I would sleep for 15 hours a day and be so exhausted I could not function. I also worked full-time and went to school full-time at this time so I decided to stop trying medications because it was severely affecting my ability to function in day-to-day life. With that being said, I still saw my psychiatrist once a month and went to therapy weekly. I will say I have not worked on the PTSD portion as much as I should but this is also due to me having ADHD and once I start bringing it up in therapy, I cannot just turn it off and it brings back significant PTSD episodes on a daily basis and I cannot turn my brain off from replaying the abuse. Then that led to more sleep issues and then bipolar episodes so I have decided that I am just not at a point in my life where I can address it to the degree that I want without it affecting my daily life.

My PTSD used to be so bad that I could not sleep in a home with anyone else as it brought intense fear and reoccurring flashbacks. This made dating difficult because most people would get offended if I said I could not spend the night and they would assume it was them even though I made it clear it was not.

I have always been extremely open about my mental health to anyone that I am interested in dating from the beginning. I recognize that everyone has their own issues and their own traumas from family or friends with similar diagnoses and I respect that it is not something that everyone wants to deal with or can handle. That is why I prefer to be upfront so they are aware of what it could be like to be with me. Because of my PTSD, I do have a very hard time with physical affection. Unless it is someone I am extremely comfortable with I don't like hugs, or being touched unexpectedly even if it's just a hand on my shoulder. I also don't like when people walk behind me because that still does induce unwanted thoughts and flashbacks to where I can be re-feeling being abused all over again but the people around me would have no idea because I mask extremely well.

Honestly, telling everyone I am interested in my deepest darkest secrets is so mentally exhausting and it feels like I cannot keep going through these talking stages. I am thinking about maybe holding off on that information unless it becomes an issue with the person I am seeing. I want them to get to know me for me and not just make assumptions based on my diagnosis. But I also don't want to blindsight them.

I am unsure of what the right answer is and I am looking for opinions. I would like to disclose that I make it a point to not let my mental health affect those around me. I am extremely self-aware of my emotions. I am not an angry person, even in my worst state I have never yelled, broken anything, or been mean to anyone. Sometimes I feel irrationally irritable and when I feel like that I let the people close to me that I am feeling that way and reassure them that it is not anything that they did but that I do not want to take any annoyance out on them so I choose to distance myself for the hours or day at most that I feel that way before reconnecting with them.

I just feel like there isn't going to be anyone who would love me and put up with my issues, especially depression and anxiety. Sometimes I have to leave places because I am not in the right state of mind or just don't have it in me to go places some days.

Now I will also say that I am a very loving partner. I like to show my love through quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service. And sexual relations aren't off the table at all, I just want to be comfortable with someone first and know that they would never pressure me into anything. I have met people who have been like that and go out of their way to make sure that they don't accidentally make me uncomfortable by touching me unexpectedly, etc. Those just haven't worked out. I'm 23 so I know that most people aren't looking for long-term relationships in this generation.

I'm sorry for the long rant. I just wanted to get some opinions on what I should do.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I have always disclosed my mental health diagnosis right off the bat before meeting, but to tell a stranger my deepest darkest secrets is extremely mentally exhausting, especially when it doesn't go anywhere after a day of talking and I realize that they're not what I am looking for or vice-versa. But I also understand that not everyone wants to deal with those with mental health issues which is why I disclose. I am wondering when the right time to bring it up is without causing mental exhaustion and wanting for someone to also give me a chance and not assume how I am based on a written mental health diagnosis.",False,False,ptsd,100208,New,2024,2,Medium,1,50,6888,neutral,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Do most people fake their SA?,57,False,False,True,True,89,False,"Ask any young person if they ever get anxious and they'll tell you ""all the time"".

Yet, everyone I meet seems to be quite functional?

SA makes it difficult to form relatiosnhips. Yet I see people with friends all the time.

SA makes it almost impossible to work jobs around other people. Yet so many people still work there.

SA makes it difficult to express yourself. Yet so many people have their own unique styles and personalities.

SA makes you very ashamed of yourself. You want to hide away. Yet so many people don't seem to be that ashamed? (for example they walk confidently, post their photos on social media, etc.)

It really feels like betrayal from them. I'm here struggling with the real thing, while everyone is enjoying their lives outside. They all say they have SA but it doesn't look like it at all.

I have SA too, but I actually (unwillingly) live the experience. I can't walk outside much, I don't have friends, and I would never post my photos online out of shame. I have no identity or personality. When I walk outside I literally want to tell everyone ""I'm sorry for existitng"". I want to be liked by everyone.

So if people really have SA, why aren't they all like this?

She's still 23 inside her fantasy

How it was supposed to be

Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?

Break-ups happen every day, you don't have to lose it

She's still 23 inside her fantasy

And you're sitting in front of me

At the restaurant, when I was still the one you want

Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right”





“Help, I'm still at the restaurant

Still sitting in a corner I haunt

Cross-legged in the dim light

They say, ""What a sad sight""

I, I stayed there

Dust collected on my pinned-up hair

I'm sure that you got a wife out there

Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware

'Cause I'm right where

I cause no harm, mind my business

If our love died young, I can't bear witness

And it's been so long

But if you ever think you got it wrong

I'm right where you left me”

Steve Jobs Death Speech Will Inspire You To Live Your Best Life,82,False,False,True,False,10,False,"Steve Jobs conquered the world of technology and personal computing obviously. Without his vision many of us would not enjoy the luxuries of our Iphones, Imacs, Ipads, Ipods, etc. He made the world a better place by increasing personal freedom and raising the status quo. Besides all that, he was a rebel, a badass, and a deeply insightful individual. 

Steve gave this speech at a commencement ceremony, and I imagine it may help someone today. 

## STEVE JOBS SPEECH

My third story, is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like.. If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: If today were the last day of my life, would I wanna do what i'm about to do, today?

And whenever the answers been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. 

Remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important tool i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure.. These things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. 

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. 

## ""You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.""

No one wants to die. And yet, death is a destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is as it should be. Because death is likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent.

It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old, and be cleared away. 

## ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else'slife.""

Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other people's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important; have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. 

## ""Stay hungry. Stay foolish.""

So I (F20) met my ""bf"" (M18) online, which isn't the best but u can't control love ig, we talked for a few months(and he sent pics of a boy saying it was him) before starting dating and then he started to act strange. 

He started by saying he had a crazy past(which i believed bc i had no reasons to doubt) where he was SA and was recovering from that so i was supportive, but he then started to say he became a girl all of sudden bc he is actually Lucifer, as the fallen angel, and that now he can't change back as boy bc he lost all his powers and he said we had a past life together with 12 kids. 

At that time i was so confused bc it all happened suddenly but then he actually started to send messages using ""mom"" ""mommy"" saying it was the ""kids"" talking to me, ofc i didn't believe anything and at that time he kept saying some men were appearing suddenly to SA ""him"" and all stuff like that. I asked him for proof but each time he was like ""but idk how but i swear it's all real and i can try to make u remember"" and even started to search how to give it to me but always failed so we broke up.

"I know why you suffer from depression, anxiety, and pain. Pills alone cannot save you. But I can...",2,False,False,True,False,8,False,"Some time ago, I told a woman:

“I love you, unconditionally.”

She replied:

“Unconditional love does not exist.”

I whispered back:

“Watch me.”

She soon broke up with me.  Partly because (as many girls have done in the past), she felt insufficient about herself in the face of someone who possesses more empathy than her.  (Sorry not sorry, that is simply a fact, not a delusion on my part.  Some of them have straight up admitted this to me). 

Unconditional love did not exist in her world…because, deep down, she believed that she was incapable of loving anyone unconditionally, and she was projecting that alleged inability onto the rest of the world.

…

My father was a diagnosable sociopath.  My grandfather partially recognized this as soon as he observed the behavior of my 5-year-old father.  I recognized it when reflecting back about how my father abused me physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually.  How could someone do the things he did to his own son?  A lack of empathy (the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing) certainly helps.  And a denial of love and an embracing of selfishness also helps.

Being raised by a diagnosable sociopath/psychopath (someone who lacks empathy), I was attracted to and attracted other sociopaths in my relationships.  My very first girlfriend admitted to me:

“I hate it when you cry about the suffering of others.  Because when you talk about how you feel bad for them and how they are hurting, it makes me feel bad about myself. Because I feel nothing.”

In that moment, I felt both scared of her, but I also admired her brutal honesty.  I still love her, despite how she hurt and cheated on me.

By the way, after intense years of therapy (something every single one of you would benefit greatly from, but most of you are too proud to recognize that, just as you go to a doctor for physical health, it is only common sense to go to a doctor for a mental health check-up), I have now gotten over my tendency to be attracted to and attract sociopaths/psychopaths.

…

So how can I help you with your depression, anxiety, and pain?

You’ve been hurt.  People have hurt you.  People are not simply dichotomously separated into two categories of empaths or sociopaths.  They are on a spectrum.  Everyone has varying degrees of empathy.

Additionally, wherever one lies on the spectrum of empathy, does not determine how they will treat others.  People do have free wills and the ability to make choices (sorry intellectual elites who believe it is all an illusion.  I understand where you are coming from, but you are wrong).

An empathetic person can live a bad life.  And a sociopath can probably live a good life.

You need to accept the hurt that has happened to you.  You need to seek professional help to work through it.  You need to find a counselor who isn’t lazy and just prescribes pills in order to make money and turn you into a safe zombie (I’m not saying all medication is bunk, take your meds).  You need to accept others, and then establish boundaries that no one can cross, in order to protect yourself.

You need to accept yourself.  You need to love yourself.  You will never find true love, or accept true love, until you can first love yourself.  It will never happen, until you realize this fact and act upon it.

You are selfish.  You are a social creature.  Like an ant, you are supposed to work for the good of the colony and your fellow humans (and all life on Earth).  As long as you are selfish, you will suffer from depression, anxiety, and pain.

And your pills will not save you.

…

Some time ago, I told a woman:

“I love you, unconditionally.”

She replied:

“Unconditional love does not exist.”

I almost believed her.

But I no longer have any doubt.

Instead, I have faith.

I have faith in myself.

I have faith in Jesus (whatever Jesus means to you, even if you are an atheist)

And most of all

No matter how much or how little empathy you possess

I have faith in you

Pain has came to an end.,3,True,False,True,False,14,True,"To anyone who reads it, i am dead.

(English is not my first language) (EDIT: im alive. it didn't work out)

I don't know where to begin. I know i am young (15m) but i am writing this to explain why I have made the decision to end my life. I want to make it clear that this choice is mine alone, and I take full responsibility for it. I've carried this weight for so long, and I can't bear it any longer. I've tried to find hope, to see a light at the end of the tunnel, but it feels like darkness surrounds me at every turn. I want you to know that this decision was not made lightly. Please understand that I am not trying to hurt anyone; I am simply trying to find peace from the turmoil within me. I've wrestled with it for months, if not years agonizing over the pain it will cause my family, friends and the love of my life. But in the end, I feel trapped in a cycle of despair, and I can't see a way out. I'm grateful for every moment i had in my life. But the pain inside me is too great, and I can't continue to suffer in silence. I hope that anyone reads it can find peace in knowing that I'm no longer in pain. I wish I could have found another way, but this feels like my only escape. Please take care of each other and don't give up. I ask for your forgiveness and understanding as you try to make sense of this. Please remember me not for how I died, but for the person I was in life.

Is it depression or a lack of support,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Last year I was working as a receptionist in an industry that I had worked my way from a commissioned sales person to the Director of Administration and Operations, but I lost that position years ago.  I found out when you work for a corporation that number #1 part of your job is to keep your mouth shut!!  I lost my job, because I reported someone who admittedly sexually harassed my staff.  I got two weeks pay and a non-disclosure to go away quietly.

I took another job and was fired over an email, because my boss forgot that I was on vacation, so I walked away from an office job and became a self employed person, working at night, just making it paycheck to paycheck.  For five years I did that until a Supervisor from my prior life contacted me about another office job.  So office to the office I go!  I watched a supervisor verbally harass staff, get into a physical altercation with another, all while I quietly kept my mouth shut and just did my job.   I resigned from there after being bullied by the sales staff, one an overzealous Christian and her politically supporting supervisor.  Neither of which I chose to separate myself for, I didn't select either program, not religion or politics, I love people for being people not the label they carry around.  My resignation paper came days after being told that I was to have no opinion in the office after the Presidential election I resigned to move to what is considered the ""best in the business"" in the area.

I interviewed with the nicest person in the world!!!  The GM came in during the interview to say that she was excited that I may be coming to work for them, she was a former manager from the first corporation.  I was the receptionist and loved what I was doing!!!   The sales staff was amazing and the support staff were great people, but the administrative staff that I worked with were not as friendly and was held at the beckon call of the Supervisor and their friend.   Long story short, I fit in with everyone, except the people that I worked with, my boss didn't like me.  The owner telling me to find a new job, but the GM telling me to hold tight and he would change his mind after he sees how good my work was - that was a LIE!

In June 2018, I took my first 2 days vacation after working there for eleven months to take my grandson out for his big 5th birthday.  After his homemade cake created birthday party his mom left him, that was a Thursday.  :(  The following Monday I returned to work and opened the building with the HR manager and told her what was going on and told her that I was thinking about filing for custody of my grandson, who had now been abandoned in my care, and she told me that it was an excellent and responsible thing to do.  When everyone came in for the day I went to see the GM, because at this point my boss hadn't spoken to me in weeks, to tell her the situation and inform her that I was going to the courthouse at lunch time.  It didn't go as well as planned and the reply came ""You will have plenty of time, because they are laying you off today.""  Just like that I lost my income and now custody gets put on the back burner, because I can't show that I can support him.

My self esteem crushed and my finances battered, I have never asked for a thing!!!

I have attended unemployment workshops, where I found that the felons in the state are getting more help than a person that has been working their entire life with no charges.  There is no individualized service and no one cares about YOUR particular situation.  You are heard in and out of the office like sheep and while you are there they tell you how to lie on a resume and how to fake your way through the interview process.  The more time spent behind bars, the greater the assistance they have to provide. 

I have applied for food stamps assistance, only to get a letter that says that I am not eligible, but they didn't include anything about my grandson on the letter.   Another agency that held a group meeting, herded in and herded out, but not one person has cared to listen to my situation alone HELP me with it.

I have fallen behind on my rent and asked my landlord to work with my on the arrears while I  work on catching up and I have given up with trying to rebuild the credit that I was working to obtain.   Yet, there is no where to turn for any answers or any help.  

I have fallen into a pit a depression, but not anger or regret.  I know that I am better than what I have become, but can find no assistance to get out.   I know that I can be so much more than I am, but I have not been given the opportunity.  

I am really mentally beaten and can't force myself back into the office work environment.  This last incident really taking a striking blow to my self esteem and my feeling of worth in the world.  I instead took to driving, using a car with 180,000 miles that I need to rely on for my daily life, working around the school schedule of the child that I am responsible for.  This week the weather and my car have failed me in helping me to make any money, on a week where everyone has their hand out asking.

Recently,  I have seen so many instances of people stepping up to help people that have been working for free, slaving for the system that they believe in.  Is there any help for people that are real and just having a hard time?   Help for people that are just in a bad situation?  Is there help for the people who have been beaten down and are just trying to find their way back up?

Is there anyone that can give some advice?

TW - I might be an abuser and I do not know how to move forward,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hello wonderful people,
  

  
I (22M) have a rather deep and sensitive topic to talk about, and there's a lot of things I want to be fully honest about to this community to get everyone's thoughts and advice for how to proceed forward. I understand that others will hold me accountable for what I've done, and I am fully prepared and willing to hear everyone out, no matter what it is that is on your minds. 

I've been conscious for years now that I might be an emotional abuser. I have habits of being manipulative, ignoring others' needs, not respecting boundaries as I should, and being extremely narcissistic at times. This feeling of being abusive has led me to cut off with several online friends over the last couple years that I was really close with, because I did not want to affect them even more than I already believed that I have, despite their insistence that I had not, especially my minor friends. I've been in a spiral since then where I've joined various online communities to talk to new people, despite the fact I know that I might be abusive, which was very much selfish on my part; I wanted people to talk to, and not to feel the ""void"" associated with what I believe myself to be. 

Because of that, I definitely feel that I've manipulated and emotionally abused some of my previous online friends, and there was a spiral of going through communities, cutting off with people because I believed that I abused them, then moving to other communities to find people to talk to to pass the time. To tell you the truth, I've looked inside myself, and I truly don't think that I cared about these people as much as I should have, as much as they deserved, despite the kindness that I was shown by plenty of them. I feel horrible for it.
  

  
To move on to a recent event, I created a group chat in a certain niche community over the summer due to boredom. I go to college, but felt all but excluded by classmates, leading me to resent others and easily get frustrated; I do not know if this has anything to do with my behavior, or if it is other reasons, because it is hard for me to place when I am ""acting up"" at times. I created that group chat to fill that void, but as usual, I talked almost fully and exclusively about myself, things that I was dealing with and issues that I had, barely asking other people about themselves, which was quite selfish, and I am now fully internalizing that now. It got to the point that I would subtly put other people's problems down to focus back on myself. 

One of the other things that I did was constantly talk about a girl I went to class with who I had a crush on, who I really had wanted to be with. I did not talk s\*xually about her, to my knowledge (I have compulsive memories at times (related to my OCD), so it is difficult to know what is true and what is false). But I was rather obsessive about my feelings, in the sense that I would constantly talk about how I was angry at other guys in my class for being closer with her than I was (particularly one guy who I got worried about), the fact that I considered myself extremely under her league, and just frustrated in general that it likely was not going to work out, because I could tell later on that my feelings were one-sided. I would constantly ask for advice, and I understand in retrospect that this was extremely intrusive into her personal life, if anything, to talk about her to random people online all the time that she didn't know; in general, I was very toxic about my feelings. 

Eventually, I sensed the energy of my ""friend group"" was off towards me, and I went into a phase (partially stemmed by my anger, partially stemmed by my intrusive false memories), where I genuinely convinced myself I was abusing the whole group, including things like being s\*xually abusive, and I was constantly checking my memory to go through the story in my head to prove to myself if I was or not. I accused myself of being an abuser and a bunch of things, partially because of the false memories and partially because I wanted to see myself be ""punished"" for things. Others reacted exactly as you'd expect, sharing my messages in their group chats about me being problematic, and one of them unblocked me to comment on a post that I had written about males that face abuse that I am attacking myself from that post, and that I ""preyed on this random girl from my college."" To elaborate more on things, I did talk to this girl to try to hint at my feelings but I never made any crude jokes or harassed her (to my knowledge), or anything of the sort, in fact I don't think she ever even knew. Although take this with a grain of salt, because I am not a self-aware person whatsoever, and I may not be recalling specific things. 

I called myself out first for my behavior before anyone else did, but it has been implied that I am a r@pist/pr@dator for having those strong unrequited feelings for someone who did not like me back, and everything that happened. So I'm questioning my own mind because of that; I don't know who to explain this to, and I genuinely don't know if I crossed a permanent line from doing that. I've fully accepted the fact that I believe that I deserve to experience consequences/punishment from other people, and that my fate should not be in my own hands; other people should be able to do exactly what they want to me for what I have done. One of my online friends has persistently defended me since it has happened, saying ""you can't even call a CELEBRITY hot, you CLEARLY DIDN'T s\*xually abuse/harass anyone,"" and that's true; I've set boundaries when it comes to talking about NSFW topics in online friend circles because some of my online friends are younger, and I want to ensure that they are protected. 

Since all this happened, I joined another online group, and in this community, I've felt genuinely welcomed and appreciated by everyone, and a genuine sense of affection that others have for me. Because of how they view me, I feel very strongly about trying to be a good person in order to deserve that appreciation, because their feelings matter strongly to me, and I want to fully embody the person that they think I am. 

I've been extremely unsure how to proceed forward, as I wonder whether I deserve to die; I spoke to a crisis counselor on the phone about this today, and the counselor, as kind as he was, did not seem to understand that I genuinely have inflicted emotional harm or done things that could inflict emotional harm on others, and interpreted things as me being genuinely confused. So, that's why I'm here: I genuinely need to get this off my chest, even though none of you have been affected by me, and be held accountable. 

In conclusion, is there any coming back from the things I have said/done involving my crush and how I have treated others, how should I hold myself accountable and how should I make amends, and is there any way that you believe that I will be able to become the good friend/person that I truly want to be, despite all of my personality issues and emotional abuse I have inflicted?",False,False,mentalhealth,443572,Hot,2024,2,Low,0,63,7094,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

“Toxic Positivity”,1,True,False,True,False,22,False,"There’s a recent post on here addressing why self-help might be making you feel worse. While the article does have its merits, and valid points, it completely ignores one basic human element- PEOPLE LEARN THROUGH REPETITION.

Yet, many people jumped on the band wagon and start degrading “Toxic Positivity.” This is truly dangerous. There is no such thing as “Toxic Positivity” unless someone is trying to convince people that they can do superhuman feats (i.e. Fly, levitate, endure subzero temperatures, or run a marathon on day 1 of training) or change other people (because of their own positivity). Being human has limitations- and being positive isn’t going to change that.

However, most people are not even looking at “Toxic Positivity” in that realm. Instead, they view it more in the realm of “Cheer up,” “You can do this,” “You’ve got it in you.” Why? Because it’s not what they want to hear.

People have been conditioning themselves to deflect accountability, “It’s not my fault,” “I didn’t choose to be this way,” “My Mom should have got me iPhone instead of a Windows smartphone.” So, when they see/hear “Cheer up,” “You can do this,” “You’ve got it in you,” it creates a conflict in their mental coding… “How can I cheer up, when this isn’t my fault?” “How can I do this, when I didn’t choose to be this way?” “How can I have it in me when my Mom ruined my life with a Windows smartphone?”

The truth is you cannot have your cake and eat it too. You are either going to choose to stay down and be defeated, or you are going to choose to get up and fight the next round, even though you know it’s going to hurt. Those are your choices in life. You can blame the world because shit didn’t go the way you wanted it to, expected it to, or hoped it would be- or you can decide to continue pressing on regardless of how/where the chips fall.  This is your life, and yours alone; therefore, that’s your choice to make.

Yes, there are f#cktons of 20-something year-old “gurus” who try to parade around as “coaches” who don’t have enough life experience to coach someone on how to remove a sliver. You know what?  Most will filter themselves out of the market in 3 years, and the cream will rise to the top. Yes, most are selling the placebo effect more than actual help. However, PEOPLE ARE NOT STUPID. Some are more vulnerable than others- but they aren’t dumb. You can spot a hustler a mile away- promises too good to be true, while appearing in front of big houses and expensive cars. That game has been played since your great-grandparents subscribed to Time magazine. Is the positivity “toxic” because it’s coming from a con-man? No.

Truthfully, any positivity (exclusion already noted) is good positivity… BECAUSE WE LEARN FROM REPETITION. Look at how many people join a gym every year (especially in January). Now consider how many years it takes for most of them to actually get serious about it. What does it take for them to get serious? That ONE time when they finally realize that they must hold themselves accountable to make the change. Look at how many people go to outpatient and residential treatment for substance abuse. Now consider that most people go right back to using within 90 days. What does it take for them to really quit? That ONE time when they finally realize that they must hold themselves accountable to make the change. Look at how many people go through life like Eeyore (Winnie-the-Pooh) with a “Woe is me…” attitude. What does it take for them to really make the change? That ONE time when they finally realize that they must hold themselves accountable to make the change. IT ALL COMES FROM THE REPETITION UNTIL IT BECOMES A CONCLUSION.

There is no “easy way” around the problems that we face, encounter, and endure that will produce beneficial results. The easy way is to take the ass-whipping life gives you and cry about it. The easy way is to slap away the hand that tries to reach out to you, as you curl up into a ball and cry even louder. The easy way is to DEFLECT blame.

“Toxic positivity” is a way to deflect blame so people don’t have to hold themselves accountable.

If you want to get fit, and you skipped the gym, then you should feel bad when you see people out riding their bikes… BECAUSE YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN. It was YOUR GOAL to get fit! No one stopped you; you made the decision not to go. If the goal isn’t that important to you- then f#cking own it instead of deflecting the blame. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to burn off those calories. Deflecting blame isn’t going to give you the body you wanted. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to give you the life that you dream of having.

If you wanted to start your own business, and you haven’t even started to research the requirements to license (and insure) it, then you should feel bad when you see other people starting their own business… BECAUSE YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN. It was YOUR GOAL to start your own business! No one stopped you; you made the decision to watch Netflix instead of YouTube tutorials. If the goal isn’t that important to you- then f#cking own it instead of deflecting the blame. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to get the business plan ready. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to set-up your office or store-front. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to allow you to quit your job and be your own boss.

If you wanted to get past the hopelessness and depression you are suffering from, and you see a million positive posts on Instagram/Facebook/Reddit, and you write them off as “Toxic Positivity,” then you see people who are out living the life you want to live, you should feel bad… BECAUSE YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN. It was YOUR GOAL to get past the hopelessness and depression. No one stopped you from making an appointment with a psychologist, counselor, or coach- no one even stopped you from reading a book, starting a journal, or researching ways to resolve unresolved issues you know you are holding onto; you made the decision to blame the world for everything- even those reaching out to help you. If feeling better isn’t that important to you- then f#cking own it instead of deflecting the blame. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to make those unresolved issues go away. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to make your life easier. Deflecting the blame isn’t going to give you the confidence to deal with the bad shit that happens in life.

This is 2021. There is no shame in asking for help. There is no shame in seeking out a professional to walk you through your issues. There is no shame wanting to be the best version of “YOU.”

Think about how fortunate we are in comparison to your great-great grandparents of 1821. We cry about Wi-Fi, when rural America didn’t get electricity until the1930’s. We cry about social media, when the telephone wasn’t even invented until 1876. We cry about transportation, when the first car wasn’t invented until 1886. Hell, we even overlook how indoor plumbing didn’t gain popularity until the 1840’s. Now think about how there was no McDonalds, Walmart, Amazon, or even Home Depot then.

We, as a population, got soft, spoiled, and take it ALL for granted. We don’t worry about snakebites tuberculosis (consumption), or where the nearest hospital is (much less if they have a surgeon or specialist). We don’t worry about planting crops in a late spring or canning food for the winter. We don’t worry about making/repairing clothes, chopping wood to heat our houses, and many of us enjoy air conditioning (not invented until 1902).

Yes- we have it good. It’s beyond good- it’s great. 2021 is better than 1821, 1921, and even better than 1971.  We have machines that do incredibly hard and difficult work, computers that do almost everything (including face to face meetings like in the ‘Jetsons’), the internet to disperse more information than ever imaginable, and GPS to help us when we’re lost.

It’s an incredible time. We have so much “down” time, that we can go online and use our hands (that have never seen a callous) and bitch about how bad our lives are. We can blame the world for our own shortcomings and other people will digitally nod (upvote, like, heart) in agreement. You can be positive, upbeat, and supportive- and people will say that you spread “Toxic Positivity.”

Wake up. If you’re not “Toxically positive”- you are in denial of the world that you live in. This isn’t 1821… You’re not going to die tomorrow of Cholera or Dysentery. You live a life that billions of people before you only dreamt about having. What are you doing to make the most of it?

So I've (F25) hit my narc mom after so many years of Illtreatment and PTSD,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Just so you know, my narc bipolar mom used to mistreat me since I'm born, but she also does with my grandma even to this day (psychologically and economically)

my cPTSD (in which I'm treated for years around borderline) just couldn't handle the facade anymore and confronted her getting physical
I'm not violent by any means, I'm the most quiet person ever, but i think today it just crossed the line and my PTSD became my anger to face my ""mom"" and somehow making boundaries for my grandma's old mind, so she cannot abuse her anymore.

Well, it all ended up with me grabbing her by neck.
After some time, she comes provoking me and that moment was the very one that unleashed the beast by punching her hard.

Violence is not the solution, I cannot excuse myself, but I cannot leave this mind state at all.
My traumas turnt into anger, agression and a way to impose MY OWN LIMITS for people whom I've tried endlessly to talk with, about these issues (ofc never being successful).

""Gladly"" this only happens with my mom, cuz she's my trigger, but it's something that rly makes me nervous due to not being an aggressive woman at all, kinda the opposite, chill and quiet to very extreme levels.

I cannot ignore the situation anymore, among lies, distorted reality of her, etc.

I usually treat My PTSD episodes by getting close to my husband and Golden Shepherd Coco, but when he (my spouse) is not with me, I'm just tense trying to cope with whatever thing my ADD mind and eyes catch. (Or whatever's left on my attention spawn bar till it runs out)

Sadly I must have contact with her, but i ignore her most of the time, talking only when necessary usually ending with short convos.

How would you deal with these kind of situations in which rage and anger are constant emotions meanwhile PTSD is ON?.

Tattoo anxiety,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I have bad anxiety in general. I have ocd as well so I obsess on certain thoughts and themes.

I’ve recently been disassociating a lot. I don’t feel like myself or like I even know who I am. No one feels real. Life feels fake. Everything around me seems fake. It makes me feel suicidal. 

On the other hand I’ve also become obsessed with how I’m perceived and feeling like I’m fake in general. That nothing I like is genuine. That I only do things to seem a certain way or whatever. Idk it’s hard to explain the thought process. 

Anyways I have a sleeve. Almost. My lower half is last of us. A clicker(which I do love) and then a city scape which he didn’t do exactly what I wanted and then My upper arm is midsommar. I hate how the tattoo looks and in general I’ve just been obsessed with how people perceive tattoos.

My partner also had a bad trip; neither of us were the source of each others anxiety, but we were simply too overwhelmed with the dosage.

 He did his best to help me once he was coming down with the help of his ssris. He suggested we go on a drive around town because I was freaking out in our apartment.
We drove in what felt like endless circles and my feeling of dread dwindled only after a few hours of this.

 Now; any time we are in the car at night time for any long stretch, I get these flashbacks which lead to panic attacks. I dissociate and feel like I am right back in the trip. This just happened and he had to take me home; and we’ve come to a point of not driving at night. I wonder if this qualifies for ptsd because otherwise I do not think about the trip, and if we never drove at night I don’t think I would be triggered. How should I best approach this?

About a month ago i thought about quitting school and working until he has enough money to leave but i didn't tell him yet,so a couple of days ago I told him and my mom at 6am that i am not going to school and that i want to quit and he immediately started screaming and scolding me so i tried to explain myself and my current mentality and he replied by hitting me and calling me a liar over and over again he kept on going why i am a liar who just doesn't want to go to school wich made me start crying, then he kicked me out saying i either go to school or get out so i started to get ready while crying to leave the house i honestly didn't know where i would go but i didn't want to stay here, he then tried to stop me and threatened to divorce my mom and leave if i didn't go to school today so i went.

I have not talked to my parents since and he has tried to talk to me but i just couldn't talk to him after what he did and i am just thinking about ending it what should I do please help.

I am not sure if my boyfriend is being too controlling or if I’m just overthinking.,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I have been in multiple abusive and controlling relationships. It’s kinda hard for me to recognize when someone is doing these things to me until I am breaking down emotionally. I also dissociate a lot so it is hard for me to remember a lot of things but when I do I fixate on them. 

I am an over thinker. I over think everything my boyfriend says and does to me and around me. I feel like he tells me what to do a lot though and I know he is insecure, which makes him controlling in certain ways. (From what I have noticed) 

Him and I took a like month break, I felt like we were done with the relationship. I got a job stripping and I was doing okay for myself. It really wasn’t a bad experience from the other stories and things I’ve heard. It was actually really nice, but I gave it up to be with him. I gave him a second chance and quit that job. He told me he didn’t want me getting caught up in that life and that I’m probably not going to find someone who actually respects me. Also that he was too insecure to be okay with other men touching me. I felt put down and I didn’t really say much. 

This morning he told me to put on makeup to look more scary. (I like the goth and alternative styles) I told him I about maybe doing that because I keep getting approached by men when I am not with him. It like really bothers him when I tell him about people hitting on me. 

Last night when he was making food in the kitchen he kept eating some of the stuff he was gonna put in the pot, when I did it he was jokingly like “ah ah ah” but then the second time I did it he told me “do as you’re told”. He said it like he was joking but he never said he was joking and I don’t remember him laughing so I just overthink it. 

Last night I also like messed up and read the time wrong, I get him from work right now. He told me that I screwed myself (which I did but that doesn’t help anything) and he gave me a choice. He said I can either stay here for three hours or go do what I was going to do and he’ll have to wait for me to come get him after he gets off work. 

I am very submissive when treated and talked to a certain way because of trauma. When he tells me what to do I feel my stomach drop. I feel scared of what he will do to me if I don’t do as he says. That’s not from him though. That is just my PTSD. From other people. 

I have just felt a bit weird. My first serious relationship was very physically controlling and I am so scared of that happening again. I am just not sure really what to think and I think I feel a little embarrassed about if I am in another controlling relationship.",True,False,ptsd,100208,New,2024,2,Low,0,83,2605,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

"Stop Making Excuses, You Can Fix Your SA By Yourself",0,False,False,True,False,4,False,"Hey guys,
don't take my title personally. I know how SA feels like and how bad it is. I lived the majority of my life with it without even knowing. I am making this post for one reason: To help others. 

I was myself helped by other redditors to overcome my SA. I still have SA, but I made progress. A lot of progress. 3 months ago, I couldn't use a public urinal. Now, I always talk in class and go to parties with people I never met. You must be thinking that I overcome SA and am a narcissist thinking I know exactly what it's like to be you. I don't. I am here to convince you to start working on curing your SA TODAY. Not tomorrow. Not with the help of a doctor. Today. If you are not getting out of your comfort zone, you are making excuses. Every single day I leave my comfort zone. Every day I make excuses and am not able to accomplish something that I would like. However, I am able to do more and more every day. I wish you guys could start doing the same.

I know some of you are not even able to leave your house. You people unfortunately have a bad case of SA. What you need to understand is that you are not born with SA. Something happened to you to change you. Social interactions have turned sour. This is why you have this. No one is just afraid of spiders, some incident must have happened. 

You must be thinking that all that I am saying is easier said than done. That is true. Overcoming social anxiety and leaving your comfort zone is so damn hard. The first time I used a urinal in about 3 years, I walked quickly to my car after taking care of business. I actually drove 2 hours to make sure I wouldn't meet someone I knew at that bathroom. Yeah, it was that bad. I was shaking, but when I got home, I felt good. The day after, I was able to go to a urinal, but still with difficulty. A week later, I didn't feel anything. 

If you are stuck in your house, order a pizza. It's simple right? Minimal contact and you are staying in a friendly environment. Do this until you are good with it. Then, it's up to you to find your next challenge. Keep using this approach. You will never completely get rid of SA and will always have it, but you can get rid of almost all symptoms.

Users, please feel free to PM me. I will do my best to help you. I will be here to support you. I am not a specialist, I am only a guy trying to help his community. 

Please, stop making excuses for yourself. Just do it. Don't think about it, just do it. I believe in you, you can do what you set yourself to.

How to find your shining path and reveal your self-worth,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Picture a diamond: if dropped in a street market, its cost is only $50; however, when placed in an antique store, it can be sold for $500. If showcased in a museum, its value suddenly jumps to $5000.

This little tale got me pondering how frequently we find ourselves questioning our own worth. The self-doubt and lack of confidence we often experience aren’t necessarily indicative of some inherent flaw. It might just be that we’re not in the right place with the right people.

Think of it as you would different plants and flowers, each with its own quirks. Some crave sunlight, others thrive in the shade. Some are delicate and need special care, while others can tough it out in any environment. Much like these plants, we, as human beings, are unique. Each of us is endowed with distinctive talents and gifts. Our true brilliance shines when we’re in an environment that nurtures our growth. That’s why I firmly believe that where you are matters more than what you do.

However, this isn’t to suggest that if we don’t succeed or thrive, the blame lies solely with the environment. Very few people are fortunate enough to be born and raised in an ideal environment. It demands our determination, persistence, and wisdom to locate the right setting. If it eludes us, we must take the initiative to create it. This journey is far from easy, as it isn’t taught in schools. Society often tricks us into thinking we should all flourish in the same type of environment. Consequently, a significant number of individuals often opt for careers based not on passion or values, but rather on prevailing trends or lucrative prospects.

While following trends can lead to success and achievement, it rarely brings true fulfillment. Fulfillment is not a science that can be learned by mimicking others; it is an art that demands creativity to carve a unique path. To find the right environment, you’ve got to know yourself — who you are, what you want, your values, your talents, your motivators, what lights you up, and what brings you down.

Yet, this is merely the beginning. In addition to knowing yourself, you must step out of your comfort zone, try new things, and explore different environments. Few people stumble upon the perfect fit right away; it usually takes a series of experiments to find that sweet spot.

We’re often scared to try new things or reluctant to let go of the old because we worry: What if the next thing is worse? Well, truth be told, it very well might not be an upgrade, but it doesn’t mean the third, fourth, or fifth attempt won’t be better. Sometimes it takes 5, 10, or even 100 tries until things start looking up. So, all you really need to find the right environment is the courage to let go of what’s not working, the resilience to bounce back after failures, and the patience to wait for the right moments. It’s those patient souls who often receive life’s greatest gifts.

And in this ongoing process of letting go, picking yourself up, and moving forward, you’re building not just resilience but also inner wisdom and strength. When you’ve amassed enough wisdom and resilience along the way, life naturally steers you towards the place that suits you best.

However, in the past, he has had some mental struggles, and so have I. My boyfriend has always kind of struggled, even after therapy, and various coping mechanisms, and I think the reason for that might be because he was perhaps misdiagnosed.

Since he had a traumatizing childhood, he has been suffering with trauma behaviors most of his life, and on and off mental illness. But it seems to be, that his diagnosis has been different, depending on what state he was in at the time he was diagnosed. So, if he was feeling depressed at the time, they gave him a clinical depression diagnosis. If he was feeling insecure, and trying to hide behind a false confidence, he was given the diagnosis of split personality disorder.

But having been his girlfriend all these years, I can testify that it most certainly cannot be true. He doesn't appear to have any clinical depression or anxiety, but rather gets depressed and anxious if he cannot cope with something. And he no longer hides behind a false confident persona, now that he has a good job, and good future prospects, and no longer is extremely ashamed of himself.

I have noticed, that amidst his current life, and in his past, he has struggled consistently with some issues that nobody has helped him with, until I came along. And as of recently, I have been suspecting ADHD. Some of these issues are that he hyperfocused on random hobbies and topics, that come and goes.

His Christian faith turns into a hyperfocus, and a reason why he even became a Christian, was because he was hyperfocusing on finding the truth about life and existence. At one point, he hyperfocused on topics within Christianity, and has hyperfocused on me at times, as well as on certain movies he has watched over and over again in a row. He can spend hours uninterrupted, listening to, or watching stuff, he is hyperfocusing on. And before you know it, he no longer cares about those things anymore.

He also seems to struggle to execute certain things others have no problem with. He finds it impossible to do the dishes, to cook something, to find something in the fridge, to see what is in front of him, even when an object lies right there before his eyes. Likewise, he cannot seem to find where he puts his things, and freaks out over it. Furthermore, he leaves his stuff in these messy piles, of no organization whatsoever, and expects to find them in that pile.

So, our floor has 4 piles of clothes and bags at the moment, where he digs out what he needs for work etc. He also cannot focus for a long time on what I say to him, and he cannot focus for a long time on certain prayers. He cannot keep his attention in social settings either, and often drifts off in thought.

When we are outside walking, he loses focus entirely on the walk and surroundings, and gets sucked into his head, and stares at the ground, as we walk, and walks faster than me, and cannot keep my slower pace.

Some mornings, he wakes up very energetic, listening to and singing to songs aggressively, like it is a drug to him. He stamps his feet, and skips around, and wakes me with thousands of kisses. We call it the ""bird""-state, because he gets all jumpy, happy, energetic and cute. But then suddenly, this disappears, and he gets normal, and struggles to get through the day.

He never needs many hours of sleep, he tends to be up and running after 5 or 6. The only work he is happy doing, is in construction, because it allows him the freedom to simply be a hard worker, and doesn't require studying. He doesn't do well with diplomacy and workplace politics.

He is not a ""put together"" person, he cannot write a CV or personal letter, but gets jobs through contacts only. He also doesn't do well with vacations/rest, because he needs to stay physically active to get rid of his excess energy. He also cannot sit still, he must fiddle with his hands sometimes, or multitask.

When he was younger, he was struggling in school, as he couldn't stay focused or interested in what was being taught. So his grades suffered. He was also a very rebellious young man, attending various shady parties, dabbling in drugs, having many sexual partners etc., and switching girlfriends quite rapidly, when he lost interest in them.

His communication skills are quite poor, he rarely communicates exactly what he thinks and feels, and allows for misunderstandings to arise. He doesn't like to talk very much, but when he can talk about certain interests and topics he likes, he can energetically talk about it for hours.

Also, he seems quite childlike, a bit immature in his way of being. I tend to take care of him the way a mother sometimes does, not on purpose, but because he really needs it to feel calm and centered. He needs a lot of physical gentle strokes, the oxytocin seems to do wonders in calming him down and making him present and relaxed.

He is a terrible planner and cannot seem to be solution oriented in times of struggle. He cannot seem to think, and needs me to figure things out for him. ""Can you remind me to...?"" is something he says quite often. He also has terrible memory, cannot remember large portions of his past, or our relationship.

And lastly, he has struggled with impulsivity for his whole life. He quickly gets fired up over the most miniscule things, out of nowhere, and then cools off just as quickly. He can get in a wrestling situation with his uncle, who is very similar to him in behavior. So I have learned kind of to predict when he will fire up and not, and what to do about it.

For example, I once served him a hamburger in a hurry, and it was not wrapped in paper, so the content fell out as he held the burger. This was excruciating to him, apparently, so he just threw the burger in the wall. The most random thing. He couldn't work out how to eat it without a paper wrapping.

He also has impulsivity in decision-making, he can make a decision out of nowhere, that is out of character. I know that he has, in the past, gambled, and randomly paid for cyber sex, but that he doesn't anymore. He also has been an impulsive shopper, and now he isn't.

Sugar is also a big thing for him, he needs his daily sugar, his porn, and such. So he is constantly in need of some type of stimulus, and when he doesn't have it, he feels out of place. He is learning to resist his impulsivity, with good habits and systems in place, for how he manages his money, etc.",False,False,mentalillness,149336,New,2024,2,Very low,1,140,6586,positive,negative,False,False,0,1,0

M/29 My life-long best friend committed self die.,3,False,False,True,False,8,False,"I have never experienced loss like this. I have been struggling to keep it all together ever since it happened. 

We are the same age. We grew up together but after high school I did some moving around. (That never had an effect on our friendship it’s just really sad to me I missed out on more time with him). Last year I moved to his town early spring and we spent nearly every day together this past summer. At the end of October he was home alone (both me and his roommate were out of town) and he ended up being high on cocaine and had alcohol in his system. Per the toxicology report. He went into his closet and grabbed an extension cord and went out onto the balcony. He called me at 12:45 am and I was asleep. I woke up around 2:30 tried to call him back and it was already too late. 

I didn’t find out for sure until one of our mutual friends that lived down the block from him called me at about 8:30 in the morning. He said his girlfriend came over that morning and she saw a person hanging from a specific balcony. He went outside and looked and called me immediately asking if I had heard from him at all. I hadn’t. He was pretty positive on what he saw so I contacted his father and he called the police to have a welfare check done. 

I left where I was and drove 2.5 hours home immediately. I met his roommate at their apartment as soon as I got to town and he was already gone and so were all of the emergency responders. We went into the apartment together and not a single thing was out of place. The only thing we noticed was his wallet on the coffee table in the living room with everything that was inside of it spread out around it. Presumably left there by the police. We went out onto the balcony and there were two removed slats from the railing leaned up against the wall. We were both in shock I honestly believe. He never said anything to either of us ever about anything like this. 

His funeral was beautiful and it was honestly so sad seeing how many people showed up that actually cared for him. He never knew. I would feel so lucky if even half of the amount of people that showed up to his funeral showed up to mine. He was an amazing person and he made a positive impact on so many peoples lives. He struggled with addiction and many other things but we never thought it was “that bad”.

If anyone has any advice or thoughts on how I can cope better please, I’m begging. I’m so lost without him. I have been depressed for months now. I don’t know what else to do. After having experienced this I would never do what he did but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to be where he was with him.

So in grade 9, I had a few friends, who I thought I could trust, I told them secrets, and they were my best friends, I knew them both since grade 4. But the MOMENT I started getting bullied, they befriended my bully to save themselves, and told him all my secrets.

Then, then I thought I could trust my mom. So I told her about my mental health, and what was going on. And now, every fucking time we get into a fight she uses my illness against me. Which I have BPD, ADHD, and ODD. 

It didn’t seem like a huge deal, I could take this I thought. Sure it hurt, but it wasn’t the worst problem. 

And then grade 10 came. And I met this girl, I thought I could trust her, because I had nobody fucking else. And guess what? She SENT MY VENTING TO THE FUCKING PRINCIPAL AND GOT ME SUSPENDED. 

At this point I split.

I lost it on her, I lost it on everyone. Until this point I made jokes about my mental health, and jokes about what happened, because I thought things would get better. 

And then grade 11 came. And I was still splitting, so I went to see therapy. AND FUCK IT. I had five fucking therapists, who all told me how they were going to help, but never actually doing anything. 

And since I realized my therapists were just making empty promises, I started talking to my principal, who did the EXACT SAME THING AS THEM.

The emotional abuse and neglect has been getting worse. We have good days but his untreated ADHD, anxiety and depression (along with c@nnabis addiction) has been so damaging to the family. We have 2 kids. Ages 7, and 9 months old. We moved to another state and he got a new schedule. I’ve tried to hold it down and be supportive, excused his lack of contributing in household responsibilities, picking up major slack, but recently he’s been especially mean to me and  our daughter randomly. Antagonistic behavior. Not following through on promises or commitments. Our intimacy is non existent. For months he says it’s because of stress. He’s been depressed for years. Bad hygiene (2 weeks without showering on average) My dad has stage 4 cancer and my grandpa just died….. I need support. I feel so done but I love him. I support him. I advocate for mental health but I can’t force him to do the work. He works and I appreciate it deeply. He made me quit my job to homeschool our daughter and be with the kids….. I have to clean after him constantly especially because his untreated adhd causes chaos to literally follow him. I have so much guilt. I just want my family. I want a supportive partner fear me and my girls feel safe with. I need security. I don’t know what else to do than leave. I know he loves us, our daughters adore him.  I’m losing my family but I feel I lost my partner a long time ago. Open to advice….. he promised he would ‘see’ about medication by going to the dr. He never did do it. We tried counseling but he was extremely negative and dismissive and unwilling to pay for it. I have post partum depression and have been on my own managing it my best but it’s like his mental health trumps everything.

however, although i felt all of this and more ( void , guilt, anhedonia, aimlessness etc) there were moments when i felt like i was on drugs. there were moments when i would zone out on a flower and cry myself dry because it was so beautiful,  and i couldnt believe we were alive at the same time. 

there would be moments when i felt like my life was so fragile and tender and i had to protect it with all my might (or the little might i had) i had instances of such deep compassion towards myself in my pain, and i felt washed by such powerful bliss, it really felt like i was high, although i wasnt. 

that bliss had a purpose, like there was something within my body, showing me life could be experienced otherwise, that i could see it through,  little specks of hope in my hopeless mind.

It comes down to one thing,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"No matter how I look at it, I am stuck in this cycle of something hurts, so I spend too much time thinking what I can do to make it not hurt.  I realized what really hurts is there hasn't been ONE woman in my life that has actually cared for me.  I was an ""oops"" baby and my mom never really wanted or liked me.  It was because of me she thought she had to stay with my dad until she got away, but neither of them liked me and were never around when I was a kid.  I was basically raised by my best friends' family.  The last one that I believe did care was my grandmother, whom I love dearly, passed several years ago.  So that aside, including my own mom, there hasn't been ONE woman in my life that has cared for me, been in my corner, stuck ""it"" out (whatever it is) through rough times, didn't leave me at my lowest or just use me.

Last week had the worst date in my life, basically got taken for $500 and ghosted.

I was friends with an ex, stayed in touch the last couple of years, but even she left me, moved away met some love of her life, had a kid, turns out he's an abusive POS and now she's several states away with a small child.  Which I would raise as my own if we were together, but she won't hear of it.  Says it would be worse for me to stop living the life I do and what I do.  I live a fairly ""mobile"" life, basically live full time on the road because of my work (which is more like a hobby they pay me for).  It makes it very difficult to meet/make long term connections, a life together or being married I've pretty much given up on.

Anyway, not that I need a relationship to feel complete or that I can't live without, I am tired of being alone ALL the time, and as I sit here and think about it, I realize not ONE woman (really any person) is truly there for me, cares, or just gives a shit really.  I liked being married, I liked being part of a team, I liked being there for someone, I liked being someone's go to, I liked having my best friend around; I just didn't like being married to a shitty person.  OLD is crap, I've tried so many times, and it 99% of the time ends up in a complete meltdown of shit, often me being trampled on or taken advantage of.  Sick of it, hence why I've cut everyone off, I just can't do it any more, I don't want anyone to care about me now, because it isn't caring about me, it's trying to get something out of me or use me for something.  I don't want to care about anyone because it ends up hurting too much.  It's been so extremely difficult to sever myself from everyone I don't HAVE to talk to, but I know I am too negative and a drag on everyone I know, nor can I stand to allow anyone to care about my any more, too much responsibility for me, and it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out and I am played as a consumable resource.  It would even be OK if these women would at LEAST play or act with some closeness or compassion, but they get what they want and I get the shaft.  So that's it, I am done with everyone, I don't know how I am going to live the rest of my life refusing to care about anyone or allow anyone to care about me when all I want is the opposite, but such as it is, and such is life today.  Nice guys finish last, people are shit, esp the women that seem to cross my path.  Don't bother with comments, I just wanted to vent because I have no one else to talk to, no one I would bother with this crap that would listen anyway.  I'm not going to kill myself, I don't need anyone else threatening me with ""wellness"" checks because I refuse to reply or communicate.  I don't need advice, I don't need consolation, I don't care about you, and I don't want you to care about me.

How do you deal with needy friends?,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"So I live in an apartment complex where I mostly keep to myself because I'm a bit of an introvert and also have social anxiety. I do have friends but I try to limit my interactions with people as to not get overwhelmed. There's this girl that lives in my apartment complex that I used to see outside walking a lot and I myself also like to get exercise. We would chat occasionally and she was pretty closed off at first as she's had some bad experiences with guys. I understood but over time she would occasionally invite me over to hang out for a bit to watch a movie or TV show. At first I would just watch whatever she wanted just to keep her company for a while on occasion since I realized she was lonely but we don't really have much in common so I kinda started to be more vocal about my interests. We would usually watch reruns of Big Bang Theory as that was something we both liked.

Over time however, she seemed to want to hang out more often and I would either have other things to do or just didn't feel like it that day. I kinda distanced myself for a while but eventually started talking to her again as I didn't mean to freeze her out or anything. I explained the social anxiety thing which she understood or seemed to anyway. One thing is (and this isn't her fault) but she has a bad memory so she does she forget things that I tell her. Not even really sure she remembers my social anxiety issues at this point, but as of late she keeps asking me to come over and I usually make up excuses but recently have been ignoring because she asks me every day and texts me all the time asking when I'm coming over next. This kinda stresses me out tbh because I don't want to be rude. She's also expressed vague romantic interest in me which I've just brushed off.

Anyway, she messaged me asking if I still wanted to be friends, etc and acting as if I'm ignoring her because I don't want to be friends which isn't true. I'm just kind of overwhelmed and need space. I currently have her on mute but I do feel bad nonetheless. Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing and how do you handle it?

My happiness may feel genuine in the moment, but it always ends up taking a turn for the worse. One moment I am experiencing something amazing, but one wrong sentence I say, or one wrong action, leads to everything going downhill.

I want to, really, but I can never take the time to get myself in a better mental state. I give others advice that I need to follow, but I never do.

"going to die, no hope (story)",0,False,False,True,False,4,False,"I've struggled with clinical depression since a child and have tried hundreds of meds that all made me worse or did nothing, I was told my only hope is a machine that reset my brain chemistry - which only really rich people can afford.


I'm going to die from teeth and infection, hospital said they don't do teeth and I'd need a sugurical dentist or w/e. 

I've tried gofundme and begging online and society has deemed me unworthy of saving. 

I tried posting on gofundme sub and they wanted pics of tax info and medical records before I could get help from them, they basically want me to dox not only myself but my doctors (which I'm not sure is even legal to ask that). 

I deal with CPTSD on top of depression. A few years ago I cut myself to the bone because I was sleeping on a broken child's bed and was in so much pain I snapped after taking an expired ambien. 

I was put into an oceans ""hospital"", before that at hospital, the girl doing my stitches wasted no time shaming me, when I was wheeled around, all the nurses (women) were staring at me like I was a murderer, they've clearly never suffered in life. 

While I was in there (oceans) I was put in the gerry section, where not only I but others were horrifically abused. 

I was forced to stay in music therapy for hours with the worst migraine, I had a Dr's note and a RX for it but even after waking up they refused to give it to me. 

I was in so much pain from migraine I started cutting my arm with my nails, they eventually said if I didn't stop they were going to punish me even more, the other patients were looking at her like she was Hitler, she told them to just keep going and I was doing it for attention. 

They made James who is blind with extreme sensitivity to light go outside in the sun, and 2 that had skincancer go in sun. 

I begged them to let them stay inside as they had enough people to take them back in while the others monitored us outside, they refused and without an explanation. 

80% of the time the food was inedible, I remember the corn dogs they served - the batter fell right off the meat and was almost still frozen. 

Hardback books are banned as they could be used as weapons, but they let Chloe (one of the skin cancer patients) get near the end of her book and took her book away. She cried up a storm. 

Most of the time they were on their phones or gossiping, I had to call out multiple times that someone was getting out of their wheel chairs - and they fell and got hurt as a result. 

This girl Leslie a little older than I, introduced herself. After shooting sh**, I told her wanna see something crazy, she said yes. I went up asking for my pain meds etc (was hours overdue), the nurse Zaire yelled my name ""JUST A MINUITE, NAME"". 

She asked why they treat me so bad, the only thing I could think is I was trying to make then do their job, which they hated. 

I was denied water so much they ordered and IV for me. 

I was on the phone with my mom telling her I felt like I was dying and am thirsty asf, the person listening in JUMPED up and acted concerned, saying to others ""oh he looks pale doesn't he, are you thirsty?"" 

You see, they keep the water thing in a closet that they keep locked, if you want a drink you have to ask one of the nurses. 

It's a small 3 inch Styrofoam cup, so you have no option of sipping on it and getting another, 90% of the time I asked for water they would act as if I didn't exist. 

One of the worst there (besides director of health) was the head nurse, she didn't wear a name tag and referred to herself as ""queen-bee"". 

I tried reporting her and I was punished for doing so, you're not allowed to go back into your room until like 10m and they wake you up at around 5AM.
Everything echoes and sound gets amplified in the building, due to this sleep is almost impossible. You'll hear them moving things and doing shi* from 1 to 3 am and it's just impossible to sleep most the time there. 

I remember in the other section they moved us to, somewhere around 2am I woke up to them laughing because this guy they called denny/Danny and Daniel (to keep his identity a secret, turns out he murdered people at a bus stop) was flinging poo on the walls. 

They were literally laughing about it, I got no sleep as a result. 

I was hit in the head multiple times by a gerry that always rambled about how he killed people for the cartel, they never did anything about it - and since I've been abused by my step-dad my entire life it set me off, it was so hard to contain myself.


The last week I was there I talked to the psych, she literally said it's amazing I didn't have homicidal thoughts.


Something to note is they get laid 200$ a day per head, and get paid for every RX they prescrib. They literally kept prescribing me things for the shi* they were doing and causing.



That's just a fraction of everything I saw/suffered in that hell hole.

Aesthetic Starvation?,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hello there!

I have a bit of an... unusual question. I am looking for leads towards literature exploring something akin to ""aesthetic starvation"". No, not anorexia fueled by vanity. Rather, the mechanisms and consequences behind the lack of man-made aesthetic stimuli. I am really lacking the proper vocabulary to express the situation in a more effective manner, so I would appreciate any terminology that would help me explore this topic.

**Disclaimer, I am not looking for a diagnosis. I already have several, thanks!**

&#x200B;

I am from Mexico City, now living in Norway. For the first time in my life, I have had to get treatment for depression and anxiety, which hasn't really worked for me. And therapy feels like going in circles. I have noticed, however, that I feel *much* better when I travel out of Norway. I really feel alive in cities like my own: sprawling urban areas with fancy opera houses, grandiose monuments, colorful lights, gigantic museums, imposing libraries, classic temples, fusion restaurants, fancy desserts, experimental fashions, subway systems, etc. My doctor said that it is common knowledge that people feel better when traveling to sunnier places. But I think it goes beyond just the lack of sun.

Many people would think that being surrounded by nature and tranquility is good for your mental health (Norwegian lack of sunlight notwithstanding), but I think I have an actual *need* for artificiality, exaggerated beauty and highly stimulating aesthetics. As in, my body starts shutting down in the absence of it. Conversely, I can feel my pupils dilating and my muscles relaxing when looking at pictures of a metropolitan skyline, a Shinto temple or a baroque palace. I am from a middle class background, so I doubt it's just being a ""spoiled rich kid"". I also thought I was just being snobbish, but having actually observable physiological reactions as described above make me think there's more to it than mere elitism.

Usually, common wisdom would dictate that those suffering maladjustment are people from small towns moving to the big city. Usually, it is understood that fresh air, nature and quiet are good for your health. But the contrary is just not even considered. Or is it? If so, who considers it? What name has it been given? What is the right search keyword to type?

Googling ""aesthetic starvation"" brings up results about anorexia. ""Big City Boy in Small Town"" *sometimes* brings up blogs about depression but no scholarly articles discussing the topic proper. ""Urbanophilia"" leads to really vacuous journal papers. And there is no such thing as a ""double reverse Stendhal Syndrome"" where homeostasis is *achieved* in the presence of great beauty. Same goes for ""The Medium Place Syndrome"".

My social anxiety (and other illnesses) ruin everything for me. Social anxiety is a big part of the reason I’ve been unemployed for years and struggled to be employed when I was employed. I never leave my apartment and never talk to my friends unless they come to me (I can’t drive anyway) and I’m too anxious to make new friends. In my early twenties (I’m 27 now), I went out a lot. I barely hopped constantly. I socialized a lot. Looking back, I think that was because I was constantly drunk while doing it. Because now that I’m sober (because I’m on psychotropic medications), it is unbearable trying to go out like that and meet people and socialize in general. I am just a constantly stressed out mess and can’t enjoy myself like that. My best friend and her boyfriend and a few of our friends and I went out for my birthday almost two weeks ago and it was so stressful for me. I couldn’t relax. I don’t know what to do about it. I’m in therapy biweekly, but I’m really not too sure what my therapist can do about it. I’m starting to realize just how severe my social anxiety is. I can’t believe there was a time I didn’t think I had it, I was definitely just fooling myself. I tried downloading dating apps, even just to make more friends and socialize more, but between the anxiety I experience and the executive dysfunction with my ADHD and it causing me to feel like I’m pulling teeth to make myself respond to a text, I ended up giving up because I couldn’t get myself to respond more than once or twice to the people who would message me.

I want to start by saying that I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ASD and ADHD which may help explain some of this.

A while ago, Me (Olivia) and my best friend Amelia (fake names for privacy reasons) found out we had relapsed on the same day because I told her I was 69 days clean then she checked and she was too, so decided that we couldn’t break the streak. We are now over 500 days clean. Amelia and I both think about relapsing a lot but we know if one of us does the other will too (I know that’s not healthy but it was accidental and has genuinely helped us stay clean.) But i’m in a really bad place mentally right now and cannot stop think about relapsing.

Please can someone help me figure out what I should do if I relapsed because i’m stuck in a really awkward situation and have none else to talk to about this.

If it does come to it i have 2 options:
Tell her and have her also relapse and probably not talk to me for ages or, don’t but, she will find out eventually and it will probably hurt more.

I just don’t want to be responsible for her relapsing and hurting herself because we’re both doing so well with it and i know she’s also having a hard time recently.

"Out of work for 3 months, going back… scared",1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Mid-November I rage quit my job. I was disappointed with myself for doing so and it caused me so much mental harm. Since I’ve been mostly unemployed. I’ve been reffing basketball to make some money, but it’s less than half my normal salary. I’ve felt like a loser, regret over leaving my former position, and running into issues trying to get employment within the same industry due to a vindictive former supervisor that is very connected in the industry. Im very qualified and good at what I do. I just didn’t like that asshole. So I quit.  I feel like it’s damaged my future success. 

During this time I fell apart. I really hit a low about 3-4 weeks ago. Since I’ve had a few offers and think I’ve settled on picking one option. I’ve been feeling a little better, but still very up and down with a ton of anxiety. On scale if my hitting low was me at 20% of my normal self I’m only back to feeling 50% my best (if that makes sense).  

Some of my current stress is picking between 2 options. Neither are perfect, but both pay between $60-$65K. I should be happy with this, yet im just terrified instead. 

Now with the thought of starting a new position, training, paperwork, meeting a bunch of new people and clients. Trying to find my way in a very different role than I’ve had. I know I have a skill set that will translate well, only it’s still very different. Im nervous, anxious, and feeling the fight or flight feeling and it’s yelling RUN!  
 
Having a hard time picking between these 2 options and in general scared of both. Having the fear is also bothering me because it’s making me feel weak. Through this process I felt like a loser. Suicide has even been a thought. I won’t do it, just something that has been in my head.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

How to find true inner peace,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Often, when asked about the friendships I treasure most, I find myself reminiscing about those that infuse my life with a sense of tranquility. One such friendship is with Vera, whom I met during my time in Vancouver. Despite our age difference – Vera is over 60 – our shared interests made it effortless to engage in deep, meaningful conversations.

What stood out about Vera was her ability to navigate life's challenges with unwavering peace and grace. Intrigued, I once asked her the secret behind her tranquility, and her response, though simple, left a profound impact on me: ""Through a lot of hardships.""

In conversations about inner peace, practices like mindfulness and meditation often take the spotlight, but true inner peace, I've come to realize, is rooted in inner strength, forged through overcoming hardships. A quote from ""The Power of Now"" encapsulates this sentiment: ""The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed deeply or experienced some profound loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension."" This rings true for inner peace as well — building inner strength precedes finding inner peace.

Inner strength serves as a grounding force, providing stability when external circumstances threaten to upend us. It is the unwavering belief in oneself when the world offers little support.

Throughout my journey, I've distilled three potent practices that have played a pivotal role in cultivating inner strength:

**1. Embrace the Moments of Silence and Stillness**

Inner strength finds its roots in our sense of inner belonging—a deep connection, acceptance, and alignment with ourselves. To nurture this unshakeable foundation, take moments to embrace silence and stillness. By slowing down, pausing, and appreciating the quietude around you, you can reconnect with your inner self. As external distractions fade away, the voice from your heart becomes clearer, guiding you towards inner peace.

**2. Practice Deep Listening**

The embodiment of inner strength is often reflected in our relationships through the practice of deep listening. This involves letting go of judgments and assumptions, focusing entirely on the other person. Deep listening is an act of love and confidence, requiring the release of control and the need for validation. It is a skill honed by those with true inner strength.

**3. Find Your Purpose**

A sense of purpose serves as an anchor in the ebb and flow of life. Regardless of external circumstances, knowing your purpose allows you to stay focused on what truly matters. Discovering your purpose requires introspection: What brings profound meaning to your life? What fulfills you? What are you willing to pursue, even without external validation or materialistic rewards? How can you leverage your gifts to add value to others' lives?

In the pursuit of lasting inner peace, let these practices be your compass, guiding you towards a profound connection with yourself and a resilient inner strength that withstands the tests of time.

Medical decisions should be based upon what the individual wants not whar a society deems to be best for the individual, and what I want most is my dignity and autonomy.  I want should I lose this battle to be able to be around my loved ones and to get to say goodbye to everyone, and  where no one is afraid they will go to jail because they let me do it. I wanr not hidden away in the dark alone. If I lose I dont want someone to find my body, I don't want anyone to ever wonder could I have done more. I want to keep the same basic rights given to every person.  ",False,False,mentalhealth,443572,Controversial,2016,5,Very low,0,31,1980,positive,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Anxiety attack deterrents?,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"For background, my depression goes through cycles that seem to be random in length and severity. 

While I call the less depressed portion a ""high"" cycle, usually it's a period of time in which I just don't care about anything. I eat because I know I have to, I work so I can work on trying to improve my life, and otherwise don't really do anything outside of absolute necessity. 

The ""low"" cycles can be as mild as just being the emotional equivalent of a septic tank or as bad as putting things in order to end it all. 

I just ended a high cycle and can tell that this low cycle is going to be horrendous. This month is always horrible, between Valentine's Day, my birthday which also happens to be the anniversary of my ex breaking up with me, three friends' and family members' wedding anniversaries I feel compelled to help celebrate, and all the associated media, products, conversations, text messages, emails, and reminders for these events; it just gets so overwhelming and every time I turn around I get blindsided by something else. 

Historically speaking, I feel worse and worse and worse as the month goes by, and I can tell that this year is going to be just so much worse. Thinking about it for just a couple of minutes just now triggered a major anxiety attack.

What can I do to mitigate the anxiety attacks? Are there supplements I can take that might help? I want to be proactive about it this year instead of reactive since that hasn't worked for the last nine years.

Therapy isn't really an option at this time as I don't have the extra $2000 annually for it. Antidepressants mess withy head in bad ways or just don't do anything at all. Talking with friends and family either doesn't have any effect or will make things worse.

Losing Weight,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I’m not sure if this is allowed, but I want to give a trigger warning because this post will be about eating habits and body weight.

I (F21) have always been (or felt like) a bigger person than everyone else. I am also tall, which doesn’t help with that sentiment. Right now, I am 5’8 and near 200lbs. This is the biggest I have ever been, and it makes me feel so horrible about myself.
When I was in high school, I was very underweight and I wasn’t eating nearly enough. I was roughly 125lbs in high school. 
I was a junior in high school when the c*vid stuff happened, and I was at home instead of out all the time. I started eating more normally and not starving myself, and I put on a good amount of weight. I got to around 160 lbs which was honestly so good for me because I didn’t feel horrible all the time like I used to. I would constantly be dizzy and just exhausted all the time, but when I started eating more I just felt good.

Over the last two years, I’ve struggled with binge eating and it’s been pretty out of control. About 6 months ago, I decided I was going to finally do something to try to combat the binge eating and get myself to a healthy weight and mindset. I started going to the gym and meal prepping as often as I could and really trying to make good choices about what I was eating. I didn’t really “diet”, but I just tried to make conscious choices about what I was eating and tried to keep in mind certain foods that I knew would send me into a binge session.

However, I had been doing this consistently for a few months, and I am still at the same weight that I have been at. I know it takes time, but I expected to see some kind of progress my now. It has been months and I am still exactly the same. 

The other day, I got so mad at myself for being fat which subconsciously sent me back into my ~starving~ mindset, like when I was in high school.

The last few days I haven’t eating anything except for some triscuits or vitamins. I have never been so obsessed about not eating before and it’s scaring me slightly that I like it so much.

I have lost 8lbs in like a week, which I know is probably just water weight but I feel like if I keep going then it will be fat too. 

I know this is bad to say, but I feel like I just needed to say it and get it off my chest.

List of Distractions (for when overwhelmed / upset),21,False,False,True,False,3,False,"List of Distractions

*So this is a list of distractions for when I’m feeling upset and/or overwhelmed, I made this for myself but will post to communities in case someone else finds them helpful. Many are from the DBT workbook but quite a few are my own ideas, too. Stay safe lovelies*,💕  

##My Distraction Plan  
1. Use R.E.S.T.  
2. Splash cold water on my face.  
3. Text someone I love (even just “I love you/hope you’re having a good day ttyl”)  
4. Exercise - go for a run or do rowing, work up a sweat and get rid of suppressed energy and tension.  
5. Shower.  
6. Listen to ASMR  
7. Take a few moments to distract myself with thoughts, calming and imaginative.  
8. Check down list of other self-care distractions, freshen up and feel good about myself.  
9. Get something accomplished by doing some chores and tidying up.  
10. Do something enjoyable, listen to music and float away on the lyrics.  

##Distract your Thoughts  

* Imagine something amazing happening, like you stumble upon a portal to another world. Will you go through, and what will you bring with you?  

* Think about someone you love / care about, and decide on something kind you can say or do for them. Give them a hug or text them (or imagine how lovely it will feel to hug them again).  

* Think about sex, with a partner or even just a crush or a celebrity you find attractive.  

* Think of something you can do on your next day off, something fun like a new project or restaurant you’ve been curious to try.  

* Remind yourself that whatever you’re worried about will come to pass (as all things to), and think about how relieved you’ll feel then, not how worried you are now.  

* Imagine you’re disguised as someone on a secret operative - stay focused on not blowing your cover!  

* Focus on the natural world around you, plants or animals, or the sky, even if it’s just looking out the window.   

* Imagine yourself as a superhero (or antihero), would you have an outfit, and what advantages or powers would you have?  

* Think about a specific animal and how they experience the world - a deer gracefully walking through a forest, or a curious octopus exploring the ocean floor.  

* Imagine yourself having a positive interaction with someone whose opinion matters to you. What do they say, are they praising you and if so why?  

* Take deep breaths and do breathing exercises. Close your eyes. Meditate if you know how, or learn how to.  

* Remember past events that were fun and exciting, and try to recall as many details about those moments as you can.  

* Listen to music or a podcast, or think about one you like or listened to recently.  

* See if you can recall all lyrics to your favourite songs and sing them in your head.  

* Dance, practice some moves or even just be silly about it.   

##Distract yourself with Chores  

* Throw out any trash that’s cluttering surfaces, empty garbage/recycle, clean the bins if they’re dirty.  

* Clean dishes and dry/put them away.  

* Dust all surfaces with a microfibre cloth, and wipe them clean if stained.  

* Do laundry (including bedding and throw blankets).  

* Clothing and accessories all put away properly (coat in closet not on the back of a chair).  

* Sweep the floors and vacuum, washed if necessary.  

* Clean the bathroom (change shower curtain liner).  

* Wash windows and windowsills.  

* Open windows to let fresh air in, and/or spray the window curtains and furniture with freshener.  

##Distract yourself with Self-Care  
**Grooming**

* Shower, shave, lotion face for hydration and lotion up body with a nice scent.  

* Trim and buff nails, get properly dressed.  

* Book a haircut and eyebrow wax if you’re overdue for one.  

* Buy some new clothing items, including new socks and underclothes.  

* Replenish any hygiene items *before* they run out.  

**Body**

* Exercise - if you don’t have a routine then draft one that includes cardio, strength and core exercises.  

* Go for a walk (weather permitting).  

* Stay hydrated, keep a bottle of water nearby and limit other beverages to tea/coffee.    

* Get attention from a partner (or) rub one out yourself.  

* Meal plan for the day or week, make a list to pick up anything you’ll need to buy and set out any freezer items for defrosting the day before.    

* Dance - it will get your heart rate up and make you feel better.  

* Did you take a multivitamin today?  

##Distract yourself with Pleasurable Activities
* Listen to music (read lyrics)  
* Listen to an audio, save memorable quotes, write a review  
* Listen to a podcast   
* Listen to ASMR   
* Read the news  
* Read a book or article  
* Watch Youtube Videos (funny, educational, tutorials)  
* Watch a movie or series, then write a review  
* Write a short story  
* Write a song  
* Write a poem  
* Write a letter to someone (don’t need to send)  
* Draw something (fan art, doodles, recreate an artwork)  
* Scrapbook (choose lyrics and cut the letters out of a paper)  
* Take a bath or shower  
* Look up a new recipe, go get the ingredients, then make it. Do a review.

* Plan an outing (museum, art gallery, park)  
* Sleep, doze or meditate  
* Join a random Discord  
* Dance  
* Take photographs or videos  
* Make edits

will yall stop self dx bpd!?!? its not fun, its ruined my life. you dont even get dx by like a dr or therapist reading you dsm-v criteria, theres a big ass test. you cant acsess that online, and you havent had the 8-10 years of med school, plus recidency, plus work experince. as a med student, half the shit you learn there isnt even avalible online. sorry but i cant really disect a human body on the mayo clinic site.

my bpd has literally ruined my life. ive self harmed a character's scars on my leg over and over due to only having my idenity based in her, i ended up getting a tattoo to stop myself from doing it. 

ive ended up in the psychward OVER TEN TIMES in the last year and a half seince my fp left me, and ive attempted 5x, and been on life support 2x.

ive broken a kids hand and and dislocated a girls knee when i was in school out of impulsive rage, i got expelled after the 2nd one. i literally almost murdered someone who told my fp to kill himself, ended up in the ward because of it.

ill have breakdowns over the stupidest shit, like losing a tv remote or being out of vape juice, and itll include hitting myself, cutting, and just flat out screaming.

i became an alcoholic after my fp left me, im almost drunk rn. its miserable and after my pets i spend all my money on vodka. i literally stole my moms card at 21 to buy vodka when i couldnt afford it.

bpd isnt fun. if you actually had bpd youd be diagnosed, weather or not you could afford it (assuming youre an adult) and even then, bpd is RARELY dx before 18, at the youngest 16 or 17. and i see so many 13-15 kids self dx it. its not fucking fun. its not ""uwu im obssesed with my bf"" or ""omg mood swings!!!"" or ""wow look at my sh scarssssss"" like its not quirky. its terrifying. its life threatening. its miserable.

worst ptsd nightmare i have ever had,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"this might be triggering for people with substance abuse history or SA victims so be careful.

i had a dream where i woke up in a bed and i felt like i was being watched because the bedroom had endless windows, so i left the bedroom and went to another one that was less spacious but it still had too many windows. i tried to sleep there, but when i closed my eyes, i woke up to the sound of my dad. he said, “i’m drinking, yeah, but it’s no big deal. i’m gonna get another drink.” and i opened my eyes and followed his voice and saw him drunk, drinking his liver dead. 

i was hurt, so i tried to walk away. he said, “where are you going? drink with me.” i ignored him and ran away, and then he disappeared. i found my mom smoking heroin and blowing it in my face. i was mad and i told her, “daddy is drinking again and now you’re back to heroin?!” and she laughed and said it was, “no big deal.”

i ran away and slept on a couch, but when i woke up on the couch again, i was still dreaming. but this time i couldn’t move, and i saw a bunch of random men surrounding me with smiles. i couldn’t speak or move my body, just my eyes. they said, “this will feel good for you.” and raped me while i could not do a thing.

i woke up again and i was back in the bed near my dad, and he looked at me with regret and said, “i’m sorry for drinking.” i ignored him and realized at this point that i was dreaming and i was stuck in a ptsd nightmare, so i tried to think of going to a place where no one could hurt me. 

i closed my eyes and imagined going to space, but as soon as i went there it was terrifying. i kept falling and falling and falling and there was not a single star in sight. it was just an endless black void of nothing. 

when i opened my eyes again, i saw the rapists again, but i could move this time. they said, “it’s such a shame you can move, now.” so i tried to run away, but everywhere i tried to run past an exit, i got stuck in this barrier that felt like trying to walk past gelatin. it kept me trapped in the room with them and i realized that i would have rather suffocated to death in the gelatin than have anyone touch me like that again.

How to Stop Caring What Others think of you,3,False,False,True,False,0,False," 

In order to stop caring what others think of you, You need to understand the root cause of this behavior and why we do it

According to psychology, Our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us. If we were criticized, neglected, or abused, we are more likely to have low self-esteem and be more sensitive to the judgments of others.

Interestingly, studies show that children as young as two years old are already aware that they’re being evaluated by others, and they will adjust their behavior to seek a positive response.  
This need for social acceptance and fear of rejection is still present in adulthood because social media has become another common approach to seek approval. where many of us consider social media personas as an extension of your self worth, even though your value as a person hasn’t changed.  
So we cant just delete this human nature out of our system so what can you do about it?

The first step is to build a strong mindset by Expecting and accepting that people will always have opinions of you, the truth is There’s no use in trying to avoid any judgment because it’s simply impossible. And when you expect that people will always have opinions, you become more resilient to criticism.

Another thing to keep in mind is when you are in social situations, STOP TRYING TO READ Other’s MINDs, Those who care about others’ opinions often believe they’re being noticed more than they really are, which is a psychological phenomenon knows as “The spotlight effect”  
But in reality we are all in a midst of our personal accomplishments and humiliating situations that most of us usually focus on what is happening to us as well as how other people see it.

After reading research studies and articles I made an[animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7ofWl5DkI) to illustrate this topic, explaining how our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us . If you prefer reading. I have included important reference links below.

"Life long insecurity, self hate, imposter syndrome, basically like a ""self existence dysmorphia"" has been ruining my entire life. I wish I knew how others perceived me",3,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I dont even know where to start.
  

  
I keep trying to write this but it just seems like im stroking my ego. I know there are so many people that actually have shitty circumstances but its like my brain is stuck in this weird spot where I cant accept what I have. 
  

  
Im doing great at work. It seems like most coworkers and my boss love me. I can fuck around as much as I want (within reason) and the boss never really gets mad at me as long as I clean up which I do. I play hard, I work hard. If any issues do come up he usually takes my side with little consideration. 
  

  
I have friends that I know genuinely care about me with things they've done or said throughout the years.
  

  
I dont understand why its so hard to accept this. 
  

  
For some reason I always felt like the last pick for everything and like I was useless.
  

  
My parents HATED that I was a very energetic, loud, and expressive child so maybe now I force myself to hide that?
  

  
Im super shy and quiet and I hate that about myself. The few people I trust know how loud and rowdy I get but everyone sees this hidden reserved side of me which I attribute to my parents always calling me an embarrassment basically?
  

  
They never praised me for my good work. If I ever did anything good the usual answers I got  are ""why didn't do more?"" or ""you want to be noticed/rewarded for something you're already supposed to be doing.""
  

  
I also know that I used to be a huge fucking bully back in elementary school. idk why but I loved pissing people off I guess. pretty much all of my current friends told me that when they first met me I'd bully and pick at them.
  

  
I think this gave me very little friends, and the perception that I was just unlikeable? Obviously that shit fucked me up throughout higher grades and I was super quiet and shy thinking people hated me for no reason.
  

  
Now im nice and care for people, work hard and people seem to like me and all I can think of is how they're all faking it to be nice for some reason.
  

  
Maybe its cuz I bullied people, maybe its cuz my parents were kinda jerks, but I grew up thinking I was worthless and unlikeable. 
  

  
But now im working hard on my socializing with people and general work ethic and people like me. People invite me to hangouts, people initiate conversation with me, they dont seem grossed out or anything by my presence and its just really hard to accept. 
  

  
I keep thinking like ""I just need one more person to say something nice about me"" but I've had that SO many times already. I worked really hard to get where I am but I cant accept it. 
  

  
I kinda wish there was a way to know how people view me. 
  

  
I see attractive people, smart people, funny people, and everyone gets their own little like general personality ""tab.""
  

  
The smart friends that always have answers for everything, the funny friends that seem to be  entertaining with zero effort, the insanely charismatic and adventurous ones that take charge and have an adventure every meet up. 
  

  
What the fuck am I?
  

  
In my head im some like awkward little dude that kinda hides and people are slightly uncomfortable to be around.
  

  
I wish I just had a way to know how others saw me.
  

  
I can infer from what people tell me but I can never be too sure and that uncertainty usually turns to doubt and then self hatred again.
  

  
Like are there people that respect me? Are there people that notice how funny I am or at least try to be/think I am, are there people who think im just stupid or maybe goofy on purpose? Are there people that respect me for the work I do or do they know im more or less guessing/faking it and making it look good?
  

  
Its just that I have so many like opinions about people. What they're good at, what they're bad at, how they loo, all this and that.
  

  
It kills me not knowing how others see me and what they think of me.

The last year I acknowledged that I am not mentally well. My two therapists have diagnosed me with chronic PTSD and I have a lot of what they keep saying somatic symptoms because I have trauma stored in my body. 

I have frequent nightmares still not a ton probably like 2-4 times a week. I have intrusive thoughts about the events. I dissociate. I try to avoid everything and anything that reminds me of the events. The smell of lavender gets me angry. I get irritable and angry when people are yelling or when I hear kids crying. I record conversations with every person I have, I have 5 cameras installed in my house. I get easily startled. I’m constantly depressed. I go days without showering. I starve myself, I’ll eat one meal a day at most. I don’t sleep much, I wake up several times at night. I have no interest or motivation to do anything I once enjoyed. I see things that aren’t there and get scared. Every day I just feel like things would be better if I was dead. I’m in so much pain every day that I don’t want to live. I don’t want to die either because of my son. But, these thoughts won’t go away. 

I guess I am questioning my diagnosis because I just had an old therapist tell me that they think I have BPD (borderline personality disorder), all because I had a really bad relationship and I was raped by another service member. And because she said that I was self-sabotaging my relationship. After that therapist, I was referred to a different one, where he diagnosed me with chronic PTSD.

My mental health has not been great. Anxiety seems to be the worst and diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. At work my anxiety translates to stress. I am in a senior trainee position. I got pulled up a few times by my manager just setting procedures straight. No disciplinary actions at first but then I had one. It broke me, I had possibly done something wrong. I haven’t seen the paper work but essentially it was pinned on me and I had to get on with it. Wether it was my fault or not I have no idea.

So all I’m judged is for my failures. No one notices the good. The hours and time I put into providing above and beyond care. I struggle at home, I cry a lot.

Why does nobody care about men?,2,False,False,True,False,21,False,"In a world obsessed with equality and inclusion, why are 50% of the population still widely discriminated against when it comes to their mental health? Sure, you have all these campaigns about men can cry too and men should speak up etc, and everyone ACTS like they agree with and support these ideas. However, aat least in my social demographic , a large majority of people just don’t care about mens feelings. We’re still constantly being told to “man up” “you’re a man you can handle it” “just deal with it”. We’re largely portrayed on social media as terrible people, who are only out to hurt women in one way or another. 

We’re taught that we should provide everything and without complaint. We’re taught that everyone else should rely on us for pretty much everything, and that our emotions just aren’t as important. We’re the last priority in every situation. Even the people closest to us don’t allow us to talk about our feelings, you just get called a bitch or told “you’re so emotional you should’ve been a girl.”

So I was initially on call and two days ago got the email I was to report. I’ve been freaking out ever since. I have clinical depression and severe anxiety, so I thought maybe my anxiety could be a medical reason for not serving.
First I didn't know what I was more terrified about, asking my psych (I'm severely uncomfortable talking to him) or serving. I finally worked up the courage after several panic attacks and crying…. and he won't do it. Which is stupid because I really don't think he knows how bad really I am because I’m so uncomfortable every time I see him I hardly can ever say anything (we also switched depression medications after I saw him in December and it does absolutely nothing for my anxiety so that part is probably completely unmanaged right now) and we don't have a formal meeting until March— one that I'm so ashamed of going to because in even asking for the excuse he made me feel like such a stupid idiot that I'm seriously considering skipping the session because I’m too afraid to talk to him.

As for me I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t what to do. I own 2 business’s and very busy with the one and the other one is in the infant stages. The main company is a hvac service company and I’ve been so busy lately that I have had to hire a guy to help with the work. My biggest issue is that I have put out a ton of money to perform these service calls that there is no money left for me to pay my bills, buy food for my family, pay our mortgage, I have been struggling to keep everything paid. I owe $17k to the CRA, and they  wants to put a lien on my house to get there money. I have tried talking to the bank to get my home equity line of credit extended to pay off the CRA and other bills but they won’t help even though I have $200k in equity in my home, I’m behind a month on my mortgage, Enmax just put a power restrictor on our house because we were behind in paying them (we borrowed $1250 from our oldest daughter to pay that), after paying that we don’t have any money at all and I mean nothing!!! My youngest daughter asked me tonight why the power went off tonight and I couldn’t tell her it was because we are broke (just said it’s a long story). I am so embarrassed about asking my oldest daughter if we can borrow money. I am currently owed over $40k in work that I have done that hasn’t been paid yet and that is stemming back to November and I currently have about another $10k that I have to invoice still for February. The company that I work for has a policy that invoices get paid 60 days from date of invoice. 

I am diabetic taking Ozempic and Metformin, the benefits company is screwing me around on some payments that are owed as well. I can’t even afford my Ozempic, thank god my dr gave me some sample packs of Ozempic before Christmas. 

Back during Covid I tried getting a CEBA loan for small business but apparently I have to small of a company as I was denied because I didn’t have $40k in non deferrable expenses. I also tried the BDC and the bank for a loan about a year later and was denied because I have bad credit now.

how to Cure anxiety,2,False,False,True,False,5,False,"It’s not that complex. If you are experiencing anxiety your are WORRIED about something. Find your ROOT CAUSE and tada anxiety vanishes day by day. 

I have been experiencing anxiety for 6 years. I’m a vet in this. Trust me 

1. Find your root cause 

How to find it ? 

JOURNALING. get a  journal and write down whatever is stressing you. NOW YOU HAVE TO GO DEEP INTO THIS THINK DEEP. A loved one passing you, stress, to busy,did you hurt someone, THINK DEEP. 

It’s gonna take time to find your root cause. It took me 5 years. Took me so long because I never STARTED TO LOOK FOR IT. I just kept “eating healthy,sleep good” which does help but not cure 

Now once I started journaling it took me like 1 month. 

Once you find your root cause fix it. So now instead of going in a cycle of fixing symptoms you cure everything. 

Same thing goes for depression if your depressed your sad about something. Find your root cause and fix it. 

I don’t know exactly how to fix a root cause but Cbt THERPAY helps but what helped me was “stages of grief” I was noticing once I was in the depprison stage of what I was grefing I went straight into denial and anxiety cane back.

You don’t always need a therapist to fix your root cause. You just have a lot of questions about this problem and anyone can help, a friend or family member. 

Now sure keep doing other things like diet,exercise,sleep, don’t overdue work, RESEARCH IF YOUR MEDICtion HAS A SIDE EFFECT OF ANXIETY this is big, (most allergy meds cause anxiety so go all NATRUAL) keep being the healthiest person you can be but at the end it’s being caused by a root problem

Advice on best kind of treatment for overcoming binge eating and cannabis habit/addiction,6,True,False,True,False,3,True,"Hey folks, I am looking to pursue some kind of treatment for a binge eating and cannabis problem which I have been dealing with for a long time. I am 28, and have had a terrible relationship with food from as young as I can remember. As young as 6 or 7 I would eat multiple candy bars in a single sitting. I realize now that I always looked for comfort in sugary foods, and my parents unfortunately weren’t really proactive with restricting the amount I could eat. 

At this point I try to eat healthy, but whenever I get stressed I will compulsively binge eat sugary snacks to the point of physical discomfort. I also do this at any occasion or event where there is a lot of food. 

I have also been a daily cannabis user for around ten years, and find it incredibly hard to stop for any significant amount of time. I definitely use it to nurse my mental health, but it has gotten to the point where the cannabis and eating is starting to really harm my health, particularly my gut and dental health.

I have reached out to the eating recover center based in Chicago, and have been offered to join a virtual outpatient program. The problem is, there will be an expectation that I would not smoke cannabis for the duration of the program. The issue here is that the program will not offer me specialized help for managing the sobriety from weed. Also the fact that it is virtual will mean there is nothing to stop me from smoking which I think would be counterproductive to the treatment. 

I am looking for a treatment plan that can cover both my issues with eating and with cannabis. I have undergone a year of cognitive behavioral therapy in the past which was aimed at anxiety, depression, jealousy and insecurity. I found it helpful but my therapist was very green and I felt we became too familiar for me to be as open as I should have been at times.

Other problems I experience include neuroticism, poor anger management, poor impulse control, low self esteem, social anxiety, low motivation, lack of focus, difficulty maintaining friendships, periods of lowered mood, excess guilt and shame and poor organization skills.

I am not hoping for a miracle, but just want to find healthier ways of coping. I strongly believe that making healthier choices for ourselves is one of the keys to a happy life, and want to focus on implementing positive changes to treat myself and others better. 

I live in Los Angeles,  and am open to all forms of treatment.

TLDR; I am eating and smoking myself to ill health and want help beating my addictions and mood problems.

My parents are pissing me off because they want to leave my BLIND dog home alone while we are on vacation,16,False,False,True,False,10,False,"Let me explain. I 18m have a 9 year old Siberian Husky that recently went blind. She is getting used to being blind but still bumps into things. It's been hard for me as I am the one who cares for her the most. It not like me family doesn't care at all but they see it as not that big of a deal.

Now the issue is that in a few hours we are supposed to leave for vacation. It is a 12 hour drive and we will be gone for 4 days. We don't take our dog with us because we are going to Vegas and it's too hot for her to handle. I was not planning on going because I want to stay here with my blind dog and care for her. I am worried she will bump into things and get hurt since she is still adapting to being blind. My parents were on board with it in the beginning but now they are demanding I go with them. I do want to go on vacation but I care more about my dog and I won't enjoy the vacation since I will just be worried the whole time. My parents also want to leave my dog outside while we're gone. She has a heated dog house but she probably won't be able to find it SINCE SHE CANT SEE ANYTHING. I can't imagine how terrified she'd be.

Maybe I am overreacting. My parents did talk to our neighbors and asked them to feed and check up on her so that's a plus. And for those wondering why I don't just stay since I am 18, it's because I have Mexican parents who don't care if l'm 18 or 31 and I apparently have to do what l'm told because I live under their roof. I also have no job so l have to do what they say even more.

I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS. I have severe anxiety so I will not be comfortable leaving my dog. I simply will not enjoy one second.

It was really fun but I got depressed and started going less till it was just the guys banging around and I’m really trying to take things seriously instead of just jamming in E or jamming in D, I really tryed making my own thing alone but I need a drummer and a bass and if I could find a keyboard/piano playing I could have a album recorded in 2 weeks at max. I just have no type of connections in Pasco and because disabled is very hard for me to get around and do things.. I only write in here because I’m afraid of going in front of people on a limb but if I had trust in the people I play with that we can pull this off fine because we have done it would make me feel otherwise and I can’t seem to find anyone around that wants to or can play jam/improv music near me. I’m nervous but mainly insecure about playing when I literally know all my modes with my eyes closed and house to use them in improv, my time is great and I know my tone is very very good..

Powerful Forgiveness Tools,0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"You have to chip away at it repeat these steps again and again before finally finding the forgiveness within you that releases the negativity from your system and let's you move on.

To hold onto resentment and grudges, replaying it over and over, actually causes more pain and keeps the open wound raw.  Although we think we are directing those thoughts at someone else, it only hurts ourselves and closes our hearts to love, freedom and happiness. 
Forgiveness of both yourself and others is the most powerful tool we have and is accessible to all of us.  Forgiving someone doesn't mean that what they did is acceptable, it means that you are releasing them and no longer giving them the power to have control over your feelings, and if you've ever felt the energetic release that real forgiveness brings, you’ll understand why we chase it so ardently.

Forgiveness releases you completely and is one of the most important conditions for happiness.

That, which you thought was such a big thing just no longer exists, it has no influence over your life… the person who forgives is truly freed and feels it on every level.
 
1. Hoʻoponopono

Hoʻoponopono (ho-o-pono-pono) is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness.

The basic premise is that anything you do that is negative including feeling bad emotions like anger, hate, enmity, etc. causes physical illness and symptoms in your body. The way to heal these issues, according to tradition, is to confess your fault or sin so that it no longer has power over you or to hurt you.

There’s a powerful forgiveness exercise that stems from the tradition, and it is simply this: Hold a picture of the person in your mind while repeating over and over and over: I am sorry, please forgive me, I love you, I thank you. Even if you don’t feel it in the beginning, just keep going. There will come a point when all of a sudden you’ll know something has changed, something is different and you personally will feel lighter and more relieved.
 
2. Bathed in white light

If you prefer something a little more visual, bathing someone in white light is a non-threatening exercise that many of us will be able to do.
Imagine the person you are angry with, or who is angry at you, standing. Then imagine yourself standing next to him and anyone else directly involved in the situation standing around you. How doesn’t matter. Now see a white light in your belly and in the belly of the main protagonist and see it growing quite quickly, until it completely encapsulates each of you. See the light join and keep expanding until it incorporates everyone in the picture. If it helps you, say I forgive you over and over again in your mind.

As the words flow, imagine all of the negative energy and emotions being released from your body and drifting away.
 
3. A Course in Miracles (ACIM) 

A Course in Miracles teaches that we cannot really achieve forgiveness ourselves, but we can ask that forgiveness is chosen for us.

Whether you prescribe to that particular philosophy or not, there’s an element of truth in the concept of sending up a prayer. Ask your deity to choose forgiveness and choose peace for you so that you can release this feeling.
 
Forgive Yourself

You may feel anger toward yourself for your part in the action, or your lack of ability to forgive and forget.   Find a positive in the negative as every situation in our life teaches us something.  If you find your thoughts going back to that unforgiving place, realise that your mind creates these thoughts and that doesn't make it a reality. So just allow the thought to come without holding on to it and look at it objectively from a distance or place it in your hand, and then let it pass by or turn your hand so it falls away.

Forgiveness is something you have to do for yourself.  Some acts are unforgivable and inexcusable and you may need a coach to help you release it.  Remember though, that just because you forgive someone, it does not mean you have to reconstruct the relationship, it means you choose to let the anger go and let a more peaceful and less stressful feeling into your life.

I know a lot of people do it, but I don’t know posting it on the internet seemed weird to me, oh well here I go, I need answers.

I got my holter monitor results a couple of days ago, everything came back mostly normal, except 188bpm during an argument with my manager which was seen as “inappropriate “ and not “abnormal” by my cardiologist since I’m 19, and my bpm can technically get to 200bpm which to me 188 should be close enough to be considered concerning?? But that’s a different story.

He also said there was nothing electrically wrong with my heart which prompted me to think everything was okay and I’m just experiencing anxiety 

Anyways, since then, I’ve had minimal palps, some flutters, some skipped beats, but once a day at most for about a week.

I started masturbating again because of this, I thought I was okay by what my cardiologist said.

the first few times nothing happened, no symptoms, no palps. did it for abt 4 days straight with this. 

the last time i did it, my heart was pumping hard, and skipped a beat, i stupidly kept going though. once i was finished, again nothing.

i was laying down, feeling sort of anxious?? then i felt a huge flutter, then fast HR after which i never felt before after a flutter.

of course this sent me into a panic, and ive been anxious and having flutters and extra beats since

this prompted me to schedule a stress test friday with my cardiologist since he said to do so if the palps keep happening.

"Christmas trees are still trauma triggers for me because of my ex, and I hate it.",0,True,False,True,False,1,False,"Three years ago, I met my now-ex from Reddit. I never had anyone in my life I related to as much as I did with her. She made me feel like all the despair and loneliness I felt by being single for my whole life had finally ""paid itself off,"" and that I didn't have to worry about being single and misunderstood anymore.  
Naive as I was, I failed to understand that just because your partner has the same tastes in music, politics, artwork, and has a strikingly similar introverted demeanor and lifestyle as you, that it's still not enough to make a connection last, especially if you find yourself begging them for transparent communication, they don't respect your boundaries or general simple requests when they're in your home, deflect responsibility with passive aggressiveness, or lie to you about how much money they have as a way to avoid paying for things.  
One of the last things my ex and I did was shop for a Christmas tree in early November. Neither of us had our own tree, and I wanted us to pick from the best selections possible. I honestly thought after consistently giving her selfless gestures, gifts and love notes that year, that asking to split the cost of a $200 tree was too much to ask for, especially when she told me months prior that she had $20,000 in her bank account. I hoped she'd see the value of putting in equal effort/contribution into a relationship if you value your partner and how often they go out of their way for you, but she ultimately didn't, and I was stonewalled every time for trying to have that kind of conversation.  
I tried patching things up with her shortly after our breakup, thinking we could establish an understanding and get back together after some time apart, but she again chose to only hear and validate her own viewpoint, which killed me. I used to feel beyond personally insulted that after being with me, she chose to attach herself to a poor, fat and ugly slob with fucked up teeth, but I had to keep reminding myself that some people just need a void to be filled after a breakup, and have lower standards for themselves than they should.  
All this time later, I still struggle blocking out a looming feeling of despair and failure whenever I see a Christmas tree, as if something's in the air and mocking the dreams I had when I was confidently sweethearted and overly selfless, thinking that's all it took for love to survive and flourish, when I had plans of marrying her in the gazebo downtown, remembering how often I used to call her my gazebo girl too.  
Thankfully this Christmas is almost over anyway, but I needed to get all of this off my chest so I can hopefully start living with a clearer mind during the next holiday season, and in general. All I can hope for is that the next woman I'm with is sympathetic and understanding when I explain why I don't have a tree, and that it'll be the healing experience I'm hoping for when I do.",False,False,ptsd,100206,Controversial,2023,12,High,0,81,2916,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

Hey, I need someone to help me find out why I have such strong feelings about this. I go to therapy biweekly to solve childhood trauma and I honestly don’t want to waste the therapist’s time on something so ridiculous. I will appreaciate any thoughts.

How I've finally made a great group of close friends and learned to socialize comfortably.,79,True,False,True,False,3,False,"Hey everyone. Sharing this guide I wrote and a bit of my personal story. I have made SO much progress in confidence, capability, and taking better care of myself. This has led to some really great friendships where I am comfortable and strong. Hope this helps!

So, I was the only child of divorced parents. I went through multiple moves and several school transfers. To say I stuck to myself as a kid would be an understatement. I was quiet and extremely reserved when I was young.

I tried to come out of my shell during high school. I overcompensated in college. And I finally found a good balance in my late twenties. I am now thriving and feel very blessed to be surrounded by dozens of friends, a few lifelong brothers, and weekly social events.

**Why socializing can be difficult, and how it can be improved:**

Connecting is difficult for many people. This is especially true for individuals with certain upbringings, personalities, and environments. If building relationships is painful, people often convince themselves they don’t need it. **IMO, the lone wolf mindset is an optional method of survival, but it falls short. The truth is, it takes a community to thrive.**

There is nothing negative about being quiet or enjoying solitude. Some of life’s greatest joys can be found within that environment. But your mental health will suffer if you don’t balance solitude with socializing. It is crucial to build close friendships and struggle through life together.

**Socializing, for me, means spending time with people you enjoy in a relaxed environment. Ideally, this happens in-person, based around a healthy activity, and with the same group of individuals.**

For some people, socializing comes naturally. But, those same people may struggle with solo activities such as exercising, meditation, and other personal mental health skills. For others, socializing may feel difficult. Thankfully, it can be learned and enjoyed just like anything else.

A good workout takes energy. You might be tired afterward. But you see exponential benefits over time, and you are always happy you did it. This is how socializing might feel when you first practice it.

Here are my most broad pieces of advice, and I can try and offer some more detailed ideas in the comments if you want.

**1)** **Start by engaging in small talk with strangers and coworkers.**

Some say small talk is “too shallow” or “boring.” But, that’s the point. Small talk is a simple back-and-forth “handshake” between two human beings who want to feel more comfortable with each other.

This “shallow” exchange is a way of looking for something to connect on, or to have “in common.”

Commenting on the weather is one of the broadest ways to connect. To start small, practice initiating conversations that may seem silly to you right now.

**2) Look for teamwork-based events.**

For those without a lot of social skills, standard parties and networking events can be draining. I HATE these, lol. The only purpose of the activity is to socialize with strangers. There are other ways to begin fun relationships.

Look for events based around a common goal. This might look like volunteering, sports teams, classes, or book clubs. A common goal makes it easier for organic friendships to grow.

 You can go to things like say, a rock climbing gym, solo. You don't need to talk to anyone for the first few days, but by day 3, people are recognizing you, and would LOVE if you just said ""Hello, how is your day going?"" to the person who happens to be standing by you. 

They will say ""Good, thanks, how about you?"" You'll say ""Good, so where are you from? And you're off to the races with some small talk which will make you both feel great. 

**3) Focus on building a few close friendships.**

Even the best socializers have many acquaintances, but only a few close friends. Spend time and effort to find them. This means proactively inviting each other to events, keeping in touch, and eventually sharing your struggles. Finding the right people for you will make this back-and-forth exchange easier.

There are many common social cues, phrases, body language signals, and other topics of conversation to master. Studying these cues through books, videos, and interactions will improve your confidence and strengthen your mental health. When you feel comfortable socializing, be sure to include it as part of your new routine.

**One of my favorite challenges:**

When I want a little boost, I will shoot out a random text to a friend, or even someone I haven't heard from in a long time.

Something like, ""Hey, hope things are going well. Just thought I'd say hi. I've been doing \*things\*. Anything new with you? No worries if I don't hear from you, talk soon.""

Phrasing things in this way means I don't get offended if I don't hear from them. And I still reached out and did my part of making a connection. Usually, these turn into just 3-4 text exchanges. That's plenty, not everything has to go the distance. I do this with many people through the year.

Is social anxiety a gift??,14,False,False,True,False,52,False,"I know that most of you will directly say ""fuck no, how can if be a gift?!""

But I invite you to have on a little thought experiment with here and keep an open mind 

There's a saying that the universe gives gifts wrapped in sandpaper 
This is for the reason that with the extra effort of unpacking sandpaper, the gift becomes more powerful

What if on the other side of your social anxiety was your gift? What if there was your purpose and meaning in life on the other side of the anxiety? 

Most of the people that I speak to who have social anxiety are the most beautiful souls I have met... they tend to have creative gifts and this feeling that they wanna do something good in the world 

But the social anxiety stops them... 

This used to be me too... I used to watch videos about random acts of kindness and I was wishing I could do it too... but my social anxiety stopped me 

After I finally decided to make overcoming my social anxiety my #1 goal, I started to unpack this ""sandpaper wrapping"" 

It took me years, because I was mostly alone but... 

On the other side of it was this crazy and outgoing, insanely happy young dude who loves life and loves people 

I started doing random acts of kindness myself, started sharing my story and even my most personal and stuff I used to be embarrassed about with pride

Now I am traveling the world while I document my journey, I keep pushing myself outside my comfort and I help people overcome social anxiety themselves and build an amazing life for themselves too.. 

I have gotten sponsors just by being really honest in my videos and not trying to pretend anything... 

My social anxiety truly was a gift wrapped in sandpaper... once I unwrapped it, it gave me purpose and meaning in life as well as allowed me to live a life I couldn't even dream of 9 years ago... 

I believe you have this potential too!!

I keep making excuses from going outside. 

I get anxious even thinking of going outside. Not because I’m afraid of people- I’m afraid bc idk what to do. 

Idek who I am anymore. 

Im anxious that I won’t Act the way I want to Act, or I look weird or walk weird.

I probably lack vitamin D 

I feel it in my body it’s lacking smt and It’s because i don’t go outside or exercise.

Im kind of scared to know the amt of years I’ve taken off of my life just by simply not Living ans going out.

It’s blue grey skies today and I’m looking out the window.

I just feel completely lost. 

I'm currently going through a really difficult time at the moment where I am moving out of my former partners home to be in my own place and I'm absolutely scared as I have never lived on my own before. The only thing keeping me going is my cat, knowing she needs me keeps me going. All I'm doing is sleeping during the day, I feel like I'm spiralling.

When I wake up in the morning, I'm already looking forward to the evening as it's my favourite time of day. 

For the first time on a very long time, I went out for a walk, I became very emotional and rung Samaritans. I didn't feel all that better tbh but I needed to speak to someone who doesn't know me. I feel like I'm wasting everyday, I sit at home thinking I need to do a, b and c but I don't do it.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I just read about a poor little 10 year old boy who committed suicide because he was bullied and I ask all of you to please keep him in your thoughts because he was one of us.,206,False,False,True,False,26,False,"This morning, I read about a little boy who has had more than 26 surgeries and had to carry a colostomy bag around with him. 

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn’t make the decision to seek help.

How do I support a depressed partner?,2,False,False,True,False,6,False,"

Tw: suicide/sh

I’ve been dating what I feel is the love of my life for 9 months. Before we got together, I knew they struggled with (tw) depression but they never talk to anyone about it so I didn’t know the severity. I (at that time) forcefully made them open up to me and they told me that they sh themself. I thought maybe we could work on it together slowly and I could help them somehow. I never experienced those feelings myself, but I really understand and care for them. Months and months go by, we end up together, and I’ve been curious about what they told me then because I’ve never noticed their scars before. I even started wondering if they were lying (didn’t believe it tho) because I never saw them. Recently, they came over and they showered before they left, and I noticed them for the first time on their arms. Where I always touch and grab them, they wear tank tops and I’ve never noticed. This broke my heart because that means they have to be recent. All I want is for my partner to feel safe with me and talk to me when they don’t feel well. I tried talking to them, reassuring I’ll love them no matter what they have to say or what’s on their mind. They always nod and say okay but they haven’t. And I don’t want to push anything on them like I did that one time because they told me they really didn’t like it, I want it to come naturally. But I’m an over thinker, and started thinking of very bad situations, like them not being here on earth with me anymore. I care and love them so much, and I wish I could take their pain away because they’re genuinely the purest and most beautiful soul I’ve ever met, I don’t ever want to live without them. What dosent help is that night I found the scars, I dreamt of them leaving me.

6 ways to instantly battle depression,27,False,False,True,False,28,False,"For those like me who scour the internet looking for ways to mitigate depression, you might already be familiar with these approaches. However, I haven't found an article that list these 6 things together. These 6 things are approaches you can immediately do. It doesn't require you to actually go anywhere or physically do anything. They just require mental engagement which makes them easily accessible. Moreover, doing these 6 things in succession of each other makes them more effective in my opinion.

Acceptance

I list this one first because I've had the most success with this approach. Start off by just accepting your situation, the good along with the bad. Don't focus on changing anything at the moment. Try and take an ""it is what it is"" approach.

Compassion

Next focus on feeling compassion toward yourself. Give yourself comfort by recognizing that, yes, you have it hard and that if you could you'd instantly make things better for yourself. Tell yourself things like, ""I'm sorry you feel this way"" and ""it's not your fault."" 

Affirmations

I like to follow up compassion with some affirmations. Focus on building yourself up (""you are wonderful human being"") and projecting a positive future (""things will get better"").

Prayer

This next one may not be your cup of tea if you are an atheist for instance or you just don't believe in prayer. However, you don't have to pray to a god or anyone/anything in particular. The most important thing is that your distracting yourself from the regular patterns of depressive thought. Sometimes it's not about a prayer being ""answered"" as much as it is about how it makes you feel. For me, I just pray to anyone who might be listening. I ask for deliverance from depression and to have a fulfilling life.

Meditation

Here, I am not necessarily recommending sit down meditation, though that can be helpful. Here, I am promoting just the observance of how you are feeling, the awareness that your experiencing this moment and possibly a little detachment from your thoughts and emotions. It's just another way to escape our depressive auto-pilot and bring some awareness and intention in your life.

Gratitude

I saved gratitude for last cause I know it can be hard to be thankful when you are depressed. Hopefully by the time you have practiced the preceeding approaches you may feel good enough to reflect on everything that is going right. You can give thanks for simply the sun coming up or the breath in your lungs; or it can be for the people in your lives or all the good that humanity has done and is capable of. Don't forget to acknowledge your strengths as well.

Feel free to experiment with the order of these as well as when you decide to implement each approach. For instance, you may just use 2 or 3 of these at any given moment. Play around with what feels right. Also if you have any practices that work for you that can be implemented immediately like these I'd like to hear them.",False,False,depression_help,93519,Controversial,2021,11,Medium,9,37,2957,negative,positive,False,False,0,1,1
Trapped with new loud neighbors and I don't know how to cope,6,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
(DV Trigger Warning)
(Sorry for the language in advance, I'm very pissed at the moment of writing this.)
Very long story short, I'm planning on moving (again) because of loud new neighbors with ongoing domestic violence. It'll be the 7th time having to deal with this source of trauma and I'm feeling pretty fucking cursed at this point. The first several times involved people I loved and cared about, so hearing these things through the walls have a severe negative effect on my mental stability.  


I get so much fight or flight adrenaline each time another sudden sound goes off from the neighbors, It's actually becoming physically painful and my joints are also starting to kill me. Every day I feel like I'm on the verge of a heart attack and I can barely eat or sleep anymore. 


It's irrational, but I'm starting to believe there's some sort of sick god or force that lulls me into a false sense of security for a while before it fucks with me again. I'm literally conditioned to never relax because the moment I can finally safely say that I've recovered from the trauma, another subhuman piece of shit shows up out of nowhere and the cycle begins again. Any strength I had in going through it the first 6 fucking times is pretty much chipped away and I sure as fuck won't be able to tolerate it one more time without losing my shit and doing something drastic. The cops are essentially useless (and literally laughed at me once, but that's another long story), and I'm debating talking to the landlord right now since the last apartment I tried that with, I got subtle threats from the neighbor that I couldn't get proof of despite trying to be anonymous. It's also illegal for me to record anything to get proof, so that's fantastic. 


The only option I have left is to leave another place I called home and let yet another cunting trashy waste of space fuckheaded piece of shit parasite invade and claim my peaceful space. I found the perfect apartment in every aspect, but of course this has to happen. 


Anyways, if I could get a recommendation for quality noise canceling headphones, that would be great. I basically have dogs ears and my hearing is INSANELY sensitive, so I would need nothing less than the best. I'll pay whatever I need to. 👍🏼I have a fan and loud podcasts for white noise to take a bit of the edge off in the meantime.

It’s like standing in a room with someone who won’t shut up but not being able to leave because the person is me.

I feel disconnected from myself and trapped in my own body and mind, I really want to exit my body, and like have a break from being around myself in the way you would a really draining relationship.

I experienced these extreme feelings for a few solid weeks when I was about 13 (I’m 16 now). It doesn’t sound like that long, but I promise it was exhausting and dehumanising.

How This Plant Helped My Social Anxiety More Than Anything (Cont'd from last week),0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hey guys, I wrote on here last week talking about how kratom has significantly improved my social anxiety. I actually am so intrigued by this plant that I started a kratom blog. The mods didn't want me to share a link to my blog, but I do want to share this story, so I hope copying and pasting here will be alright. 

Kratom is a plant from Southeast Asia that is in the coffee family. In recent years, kratom use has exploded in popularity in the United States. Though commonly used as a pain medicine and/or therapy for recovering addicts, there are many who are finding kratom to be an extremely effective option for depression and anxiety issues. As someone who has personally suffered from social anxiety and depression since a young age, this plant has provided me with the relief I have been yearning for for a long time. The physiological symptoms of anxiety I used to get: heart pounding, sweating, shortness of breath, and general feeling of hopelessness etc, have been significantly reduced if not completely eliminated by kratom.

I tried so many things to overcome my social anxiety before this. I read self help CBT books, tried meditation (which works very well), yoga, exercise, float tanks, and many other things. At the end of the day, all these things were helpful, but felt like constant maintenance. For someone who suffers from depression, it can be hard to find the motivation day in and day out to do these things. It is almost unreasonable to expect from a depressed person.

Although I had never seen a therapist or been prescribed medication, I had tried xanax and felt like it took away my personality, and drained me of my charisma.

Many of us with social anxiety actually have outgoing personalities, but are so overshadowed with fear and anxiety that we just cannot be ourselves. When I took xanax I felt like it took away a part of who I was. Xanax also didn't even eliminate my panic attacks very well. To rid myself of a panic attack with xanax would have required some serious sedation - to the point I'd be drooling on myself. Since I knew how addictive and destructive benzodiazepine could be, I was never a big fan of it for treating my anxiety.

Kratom has not magically turned me into a social butterfly, but it has eliminated the panic attacks and physiological symptoms I would get from social anxiety. My anxiety was so bad that I would worry about how people would react to my symptoms. ""What will they think when they see my hands are shaking?"" As you can see, I was several steps away from getting to the root of my problem.

You might be wondering, is kratom addictive? Most users of kratom will report it is no more addictive than coffee. I drink kratom every day. When I stopped, I did get a mild fever, but it was nothing I couldn't work under. I drink coffee every day also. While I don't think the withdrawals from coffee would be as bad as kratom, neither of them have caused any issues with my life being unmanageable. For this reason, I can take kratom daily at responsible doses and have not had any regrets with this decision in two years of use.

For now, kratom use has been tremendously helpful in alleviating my anxiety and depression. I have recommended it to others online with social anxiety and they have found the same relief I did, and have thanked me. It would be very rewarding to me to help others suffering from social anxiety by spreading the word about this amazing plant. I no longer live in fear and if you suffer from social anxiety please consider giving kratom a try!",False,False,socialanxiety,401691,Controversial,2017,10,Low,0,82,3547,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,0

So Lost,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Maybe an open letter is what this is, but I don't really know anymore. So for the past few months I've been struggling with depression, though I am making it out alive, I'm not really ""Living"" life to the fullest anymore. I think and feel that I am progressively getting worse, and just one more bad day will spiral me down. 
  

  
I have told this countless times to a best friend of mine who've done nothing but to support me the best he can too, but of course, he will always have a limit on what he can really do and impact my life. I know that I myself am the only one that can pull out myself from this hole that I continue digging for myself, as I have done back then, but man it feels as if even I do good, or try become a little bit better, I am still stuck in the same place. I honestly am tired of the way I am right now, and have tried to make changes so that I don't let my family and friends down. But yeah, here I am right now, yet again, trying to spill the words that I can't and won't really be able to say in real life. But the thing is, I can't really get out of this hole like I did back then. I honestly feel like it's pathetic now, the way I am constantly falling down no matter how much I try to get back up. As I've realized that no matter how much I talk with people who really mattered to me about how I feel, and how much they try to help me, it just seems, that I just get pulled back down by myself. I don't know what kind of help I need, but being self aware is a step right?. I don't think I need to explain my background, but for some little context, I've been struggling with depression since high school, and yeah it got better but then again, heartbreaks happen, and yeah, I'd relapse again. But of course, being the ""self-improver"" I am, I'd manage to try and better myself yet again, only to be met with a heartbreak much worse. Worse things happned after, even through my effort, will not be elaborating what that is cause it's a real long story, but yeah, I take responsibility for whatever hell I put myself through. 
  
Juggling now with the emotions my body deals me with, withering my mind with what little sanity I have left. I think I'll go insane if I don't hold my shit together with the things that I know and things I've seen. I used to cry a lot, but now, I just can't, I don't know, I've really changed, but this is a sign of depression obviously. I feel hopeless, I don't want to live this life, I really want to just die. But I can't just do that, I'd be letting anyone down, but I am doing the same being the way I am right now. 
  

  
Maybe this read was too long, but it's the only way I can say these things, maybe I bored the people who are reading this right now, but this is a place for listening too, right?. I just want to get better, to be better. I really do. I won't deny it. It's difficult for me. I am struggling, but these are the cards I am dealt with. I can only move forward, with or without hope, It's really hard to pick up the pieces of my heart that was broken all by myself eh? maybe this was too long for a read anymore. I guess thank you for reading or listening at least. I need help. That's the thing I will never be able to deny.

And I didnt have the balls to ask that latin beauty her number before I got discharged.

And, I want to go into a mental facility to wait out the day that my idiot family dies off. Especially my parents. 

 I am 28. Asian. And I have committed violent criminal acts as outbursts of rage, against my family, and against strangers as well. I also have a extensive felony record (narcotics). I am pretty sure that my next arrest is domestic battery or patricide. 

So I say, you institutionalize me pronto, payable by local and Federal government, For the rest of my life, or my family dies immediately. 

The kids don't have to be cooped up with us. But I want them to visit ""Mom and Dad"" at least annually. And I expect their legal guardians to treat them well in our absence.

If we have a daughter, the first jackass that gets her pregnant, and dumps her, while high fiving his bros, I am going to fucking kill. No psych ward will hold me back. I will take staff as hostages until I get let out to avenge our children. 

The first ""boyfriend"" of my future daughter, will get a ass kicking, and some very foreboding threats if he breaks her heart.

Either that, or I will escape and shotgun-wed his ass to my daughter. Complete with point blank discharges of my shotgun next to his ear as soon as he says ""I do"", and I yell ""Yee-Haw!!!"". BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!

We are researchers at the University of Oxford looking for **females aged 16-21 years old**. We are looking for people who feel that they **have eating, or body image, concerns** (they do not need to have an official diagnosis), and also **people who do not feel that they have eating or body image concerns.**

**Could this be you or your young person?**

We are curious to learn more about the links between social media use and eating and body image concerns. By gaining a better understanding of the role social media may play in adolescent eating and body image difficulties, we may be able to help develop more effective treatments in the future.

The **anonymous study** will be completed online and will involve answering some questionnaires and engaging in short comparison and grounding tasks, it should take approximately 20-30 minutes in total.

**If you might be interested in taking part, please follow the link here to find out more information:** [**http://tinyurl.com/yj3x5vud**](http://tinyurl.com/yj3x5vud)

I’ve lived alone for a long time and have been secretly battling mental health in the forms of health anxiety and on and off mild depression for a while. I have a small but great family who I speak to every few days and lots of friends I speak to often. I’m generally an optimist but still feel down most evenings when I’m alone and I am stuck in this routine when I spend every evening in front of the sofa piling on the pounds and binge watching tv. I feel behind on life as at 32 I’d have wanted to settle down by now but my confidence isn’t at it’s best and my life has become very monotonous and I always try to do new and exciting things but the excitement is always short term. This has consequently effected my weight too and has really effected my relationships and confidence for a long time. 

Most would say I’m mentally headstrong (I am quite resilient in general but it’s the evenings I really struggle with when I’m alone with my thoughts and just overthink life in general). I don’t find pleasure in many things anymore and for the past few years I begun getting addicted to online gambling. I earn an ok wage so it’s never been more than I can afford but I feel guilty in having spent about £4000 across these few years on gambling games.

"The Warden of Superjail killed my friends 3 years ago, and it's only now that I feel comfortable enough to talk about it.",1,False,False,True,False,2,False," 

I was only 16 years old at the time of this event. I was a big fan of hiking, so every summer, my friends would invite me to travel around the country to set up camp. We were in a Honda Accord bound for the next city a few miles off the Oregon State. It was a beautiful sunny day - not a cloud in the sky, a perfect day for hiking. Me, Adam Ruyle, Sarah White, Mike Davis, and Jake Mills were heading out of the city to the next town, located some miles between a heavily forested area, dominated by tall, dense foliage and trees so dense and thick that it appeared as though they were blocking out the sun's rays. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and stranded. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the giggling of a lunatic... also a sickening odor like that of blood. The noise got closer to the car and it was then we heard a loud whipping sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a tall man, about six feet high, sticking straight up out of the water of the nearby pond. On top of his head was a tall hat with a reddish-pink ribbon. He appeared several more times, getting closer to the car. Words could not describe our fear. ''What do you think that was?'' Jake asked. ''Well, it definitely was no car, that's for sure'' said Adam. ''Maybe it's some kind of monster?'' Sarah joked. Then we just stared at each other in silence. Suddenly, everything went inexplicably silent. Not a bird chirped, not a bush rustled, not even the rain seemed to make any noise all of a sudden. I suddenly felt a pair of icy-cold hands squeeze around my stomach. ''We're dead. We died in that storm.'' Jake whimpered. ''No, no, we're going to be fine, trust me. We'll get back to town in a few hours.'' I said. ''Well, I hope so, I have a date tonight.'' said Mike. The atmosphere became less tense, and we began sharing cigarettes for the next twenty minutes.

The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. That is when we panicked. All five of us grabbed our coats and went into the woods.. 'Keep together and try for the town!' I yelled.

After we were in the woods, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. The first scream lasted for what seemed like half a minute. I heard Adam call; ''he's got Sarah! He's got Sarah! Hey, help me! I gotta get out of here-'' - his voice was cut off in an abrupt cry.

The woods became eerily silent. I yelled ''Hey! Where is everyone? Adam, Sarah, Mike, where are you?'' from here on, it was just me and Jake. Jake grimaced and then fell to his knees. ''What's wrong?'' I asked him. ''Cramps.'' he said. I carried him with his arm wrapped around my neck. I carried him for what seemed like hours. Suddenly a flash of lightning illuminated the silhouette of a clearing. ''We're saved! Come on Jake, the clearing is just over the next hill.'' Then a gust of wind from the storm yanked Jake from me, causing me to fall flat on my face.

When I came to, I saw Jake running ahead of me, then that tall purple clad man suddenly appeared right next to him. I got a closer look at him just before my last friend was killed. He was wearing round, large, yellow-tinted glasses. He was wearing a purple suit, with a reddish-pink bowtie. Under his purple suit was a pale yellow blouse, and he had a gap between his two upper teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a pinkish cummerbund when he appeared for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were brown.

From there, I must have blacked out from the shock, as the last thing I can remember is my legs burning like fire from all the running, and my insides shaking uncontrollably in fear. I honestly thought I was dead - an endless void of blackness as my mind shattered, unable to take in what I'd just witnessed. I finally made it to the town, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I walked around and was found by the rescue unit. I was in shock, and from there, I'd suffer a nervous breakdown which lasted approximately three months before I could return to work.

There was an employee at the rescue unit who I told my story to, he maintained eye contact with me, and nodded every couple of seconds. After I had finished, he told me in a Southern-accented drawl ''you know,'' he said, ''the world has many secrets. There is a lot we don't know about, and people don't wish to believe something such as this is truth, because they are scared to. I believe you, but there isn't much I can do.''

I was in hospital for a couple of days, and there were times where I contemplated if I seriously believed what I had remembered. But that's when reality kicked me in the gut and I knew that my friends were dead, and that thing/person that got them was real.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has had encounters with this person or thing.

[PSA/Rant] Research vs self-diagnosis,115,False,False,True,False,24,False,"This is a PSA/rant on learning about your mental health issues and getting a proper diagnosis.

I, like many of you, have suffered silently for many years before seeking out professional help and being diagnosed. In my case, it has taken just over a decade and for many others, undoubtedly much longer than that. For me, the reason was a mix of all or at least the overwhelming majority of my family and friends (whom I, eventually, after many years opened up to or seek help from) not accepting or believing my problems and/or not knowing how to help me. Not to say there haven't been people who have helped me immensely, but hear me out...

This lack of help, knowledge and skills, lead me to do my research on mental health issues and eventually come to find specific issues which I felt were very close to what I have been dealing with day-to-day. It is my understanding that mental health issues often lead to developing other mental health issues, and that there is usually a large overlap of symptoms between a lot of these issues.

In my search, I often came across the advice to not self-diagnose, and while I think it is wise to be doubtful of my judgement knowing that I am not a trained professional, I also disagree with what I felt was usually implied by the above advice, which is to assume that you are probably wrong until you are properly diagnosed by a professional.

I know that for some, it can become a problem. It's easy to look up the symptoms of the probably thousands of known mental health illnesses and with how many symptoms overlap, it is no doubt easy to mistakenly diagnose issues incorrectly and to go down that rabbit hole.

But I also know that it has been quite helpful for me to learn about different mental health issues and to come across issues that I was later diagnosed with.

I think knowing what my issues were (in my opinion) most likely to be helped me in a lot of different ways.

For one, mental health struggles can make you feel extremely lonely and alone and knowing what I might suffer from helped me feel a little more accepted and less like I was the only one and like I was making it all up, something that's been a huge doubt for me ever since I came to learn that I had mental health issues years ago.

Secondly, I was able to learn from the many great online resources that are available and to find out about things that have helped others in a similar situation to me and how to better deal with my problems.

Something else that doing my research helped me with later on was accepting that I had lots of mental issues and that they are quite severe. I know that if my research hadn't prepared me for that, I would have had a much harder time accepting that.

In conclusion, I think that while you obviously should not take your guesses as a professional diagnosis, it's perfectly ok to do your research and to bring yourself some comfort and a sense of acceptance by learning more about the issues that you suspect you may have.

I'm not sure if I was quite able to put my thoughts into words here, but I had some advice that I wish I could've given my younger self and that is not to be scared to learn about what you think your problems could be if you find that helpful and I thought that maybe someone out there will be able to take my advice and benefit from it.

An extreme example is my ex best friend who I lived with. We met in mental health treatment and were very close- she knows so much about me.

She knew my past AND she knew I wasn’t a physically violent person and wouldn’t fight back. She also knew I hated yelling but would yell at me all the time. This is besides her 0 attempts to try to be quieter in general or warn me before things like the blender, vacuum, etc. Thankfully we are estranged now.

But I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours.

"From a Former ""Good"" Kid",1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I'm currently 16F. I grew up as a gifted kid who was known for being mature for her age. Don't get me wrong, I was, and still am competent and smart. However, I'm not exactly the same now.

The younger me cared about getting good grades, and I DID. I was ""mature enough"" to babysit my younger family members from the ages of 7-12. I cared about eating healthy (though I still loved sweets). I was a huge goody-two shoes. I had goals and drive.

Now...I'm not exactly the same shiny, good kid I used to be. Negative consequences don't affect me anymore. I eat too many sweets and I don't care if I get sick or cavities. If I don't like my homework, I don't do it. I know college is coming up soon, but I'm not exactly pumped to get my grades up. I know if I go to bed late I'll be tired, but I don't care enough to go to bed early. I don't have as many goals as I used to. 

I spend a lot of my free time scrolling social media or pacing around my room daydreaming to music. Or thinking about getting love from guys. My goody-two-shoes nature seems to have manifested into OCD-like symptoms. I haven't truly enjoyed life since I started high school. 

I know my mind isn't exacly well. My family has seen this change right before their eyes. They see how I sit around like a lump; how I'm not as spunky and serious about things.

Would it be even worth getting into the dating scene at 26?,0,False,False,True,False,5,False,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but here it goes.

As a man that has never had a girlfriend, been kissed, and is still a virgin, I have serious doubts if I still desire any human relationship platonic or romantic

I had a very sheltered adolescence and I missed out on a lot. Things part of me still wants to experience, but given my age, it would be vastly inferior to the experience I would have gotten at 19.

There's a magic that is to be had in adolescence in human relationships that can never be replicated as an adult.

Women peak physically between 18 and 22 and they really drop as the years go by. They are also at their most fun. I'm at an age now where a lot of women are beginning to become marriage and child hungry.

There's a seriousness and maturity to adulthood that makes human relationships dull.

I really think I should never give dating a chance at this point. Truth is, what I truly want is a replication of what I could have gotten in my adolescence and college years. I really wish I had the college experience.

I wish I can date 19 year olds. But society's pressure is overwhelming. I miss the energy and innocence of those years. There's nothing I can do however and I'm stuck with a ugly boring old lot.

I'm open to children, but if only and only if my partner waited till my mid-40's. That's a big ask, and I may as well not have them at all. But I'm serious when I say I want to make up for lost time. That's why I'm high on the idea of an age-gap relationship and I am open to adaption.

This turned into a long rant. But I just think dating is something I missed the boat on. Friendships as well. Adult friendships suck. I just think romantic relationships are just too serious now, when I really just want to have innocent fun.

"So super freaking exciting that I got published for my second time writing about my mental illness!! I share my story of how ‘I Reclaimed My Body From Hate’ & am so proud that my voice of raw, unfiltered honesty about my trans identity & struggles with body image, trauma & recovery got published! 🖤",0,False,False,True,False,2,False,"*""How am I reclaiming my body?”* 

I am asked by, Haley Jakobson, my friend for a challenge she started. This challenge is the whole reason you are even reading this right now. I ponder the question. A few answers pop up, then push them away thinking they are too personal, so I say I will go to back to thinking about it later. I mindlessly watch Tv, zone out, but the tantalizing question keeps whispering in my ear and finally an hour later I finally confront it.

I reclaim my body everyday that I no longer cut it’s beautiful, unique shade of carmel- honey-brown-sugar and in return, the counter on my phone applauds me by tallying another day clean. I reclaim my body with every morsel of food I eat to nourish my body. Is it fun to have to force yourself to eat sometimes? Or realize it’s 10pm and you’ve gotten though another day without food and find satisfaction in that, but also sadness because it’s not fair to yourself? Absolfuckinglutly not. With every sip of water I drink my body silently thanks me. Every cigarette I don’t smoke anymore and pollute my lungs with is a victory after 7 years of wasted money, stinking clothes and rotting breath. I reclaim my body when I remind myself that it is mine and nobody else’s and that \*I\* am in control from here on out. It’s revolutionary when I have the small “it wasn’t your fault” moments and feel that I no longer have to feel like a victim- they are few and far between but those are moments to be cherished. I reclaim my body when I see myself as more than my physical body and include my beautiful, brilliant, creative, afflicted mind as part as my whole self. I am not the sum of my physical parts.

Even in the moments when I all I can see are is damaged parts; the fat, hideousness, disgust, shame, laziness, loneliness, mental illness and sickness that swallow me whole, I try to salvage the idea that I am not a failure. I am intelligent, well spoken, educated and have an alacrity and appetite to learn more and more about the topics that interest me. I always say, (especially when it comes to dating) “I would rather be respected for my mind than my body.” Body shapes and sizes are ephemeral, intelligence is forever.

I reclaimed my body and soul when I declared my trans identity and express that in a plethora of ways because of the fluidity of my gender expression is infitie. On August 8, 2016 I surgically reclaimed my physical body.

I reclaim my body when I write because all the neurons and synapses in my brain are firing at once. When words surge at the speed of light out of my fingertips and onto a page and simultaneously thoughts erupt out of my brain like lava exploding out of a volcano--I must find a way to express myself because spoken words won’t suffice. My body is reclaimed when I speak about my mental illness because I can use my brain, (a seemingly endless mocking dichotomy of strength and weakness) as a beacon of hope for others because I am articulate, open and honest. I can show my scars, tell my stories, share the trauma and what lead me to who I am today. I use my lips that I once hated because people, men, used to make sexual comments about them to share my message of hope.

I am reclaiming my body when I go to therapy 2 times a week to work on the skewed and sometimes illogical beliefs I hold about myself and my body. I am challenged by a brilliant therapist to really look at myself and thoughts and notions about myself and the world and question if what I am thinking or feeling is coming from an emotional place or a place of logic.

The problem is, I'm obsessed with the idea of having someone it makes me hard to concentrate on something else. Whenever I see couples I feel down, whenever someone talks about sex it feels even worse because I have my natural needs as well as we humans tend to have. 

I don't feel like I'm ugly, I do sport, I socialize little by little, and I try to stay positive and believe in a possibility I'll have someone in the future even if it doesn't feel this way at this time.

To regulate my anxiety with this each person in my contacts gets their own ringtone when the phone is ringing, I have assigned ringtones to the contacts.

My anxiety was even something people could observe for themselves: I would shake so uncontrollably, such a marked reaction that it could not have been overlooked, but I would have no idea where this overpowering discomfort and fear were coming from.

The most embarrassing calls are those that come in restricted numbers or those with no caller ID, which on top of that add an extra level of anxiety and make me even more vulnerable.

A recent incident with Rocket Mortgage only added to that issue. They even called me a couple of times within a day. With every ring, my anxiety amplified, hit through the roof, then developed into becoming extra panicky. Finally, after the sixth try, I picked up to realize that it was Rocket Mortgage on the line. Waves of frustration and anxiety rolled over me, and it is a fact that I had to tell them how ridiculous it was to call up to 6 times in a day and how much anxiety this was causing me.

I was talking about some events that happened to me when I was much younger that may have affected how I view things and act as an adult and he stopped me, saying ""whoa whoa whoa"" as I was talking.

He then told me i was ""just there to vent"" and that I was ""risking his mental health as well as my own"" by (his words) dumping my trauma on others because I can't handle it.

To make matters worse I live with my MiL who is also self isolating for the next two weeks and while I get on with her, I’m not much of a people person and prefer my own company. She makes my anxiety worse by constantly hovering around and I’m always on edge thinking I’m getting in her way.

I like having my little routine of going to the gym in the morning then the coffee shop followed by the library to study in the afternoon and I’m gonna be so lost without that routine and my anxiety is through the roof and I am already panicking that’s it never going to go back to normal and my shaky plans that I’ve been making and my little goals I’ve been working for are just pointless and I might as well forget them and I just cant reassure myself that things are gonna be okay even though I’m over reacting and being really insensitive while there’s people suffering and people who have lost loved ones and I’m just complaining about my routine being lost

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for this but if anyone can offer advice on how to take my anxiety down a level when I can’t even go and get my prescription renewed and I know I’m gonna run out of meds soon so that isn’t helping either.

Splitting emotions? What does it mean?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Just posting this while in the middle of a mental breakdown trying to see if this is normal or if anyone has advice.

I've realized recently that my brain is in one of two states at any given time:

1. Feeling level headed, able to internalize emotions and feelings, very self aware, very social, as happy as I can get, sometimes euphoric. This is the closest thing I can describe as ""me"" I suppose but I don't always feel like a real person or that I am ""alive"". Oddly enough I can pretty much understand exactly what's going on with me when I'm in this ""mindset"" or whatever you would call it.

2. Crying and feeling angry over rather minor things (example, today my boyfriend didn't want to hang out because he's sick. I shouldn't care but I feel like my heart is ripped out of my chest at the moment and I feel insane. I feel like he doesn't love me, and I feel very irrational). I usually have a panic attack during this as well which makes it more intense. Normally I turn to self sabotage and tend to be more manipulative. I normally don't even realize I'm getting like this until I type something out that's mean or manipulative, and it's only if I catch it before it's too late (which I recently started doing but that's because I've been very down emotionally the past two weeks). This happens at the same time as any immense emotions I feel (normally feeling anxious, sick, or depressed triggers this).

I'm trying to get my life together at the moment and I'm seeing moments of this in my new relationship, and I'm trying to get control of it. My boyfriend's very understanding and loving and I don't want to fuck this up. I feel like this is probably something I've done for a very long time that I'm just realizing.

"Break, then get stronger",115,True,False,True,False,18,False,"Like a muscle tearing when you lift weights, at first it hurts. The following day you're not able to do the things you normally do without some pain involved in the movements. Getting a cup off the top shelf seems like a chore, and you ache days later. Over time and repetition, what once caused you pain has become building blocks for you to become stronger later. 

People, life events, and life tragedies all can cause you this pain; in the beginning, these all cause pain. The death of a loved one, losing your home, bullies, or a breakup. All of these things hurt in the beginning. But with time, just like a muscle healing, you can use this pain to grow and become stronger. 

Its okay to grace yourself with time. Pain is a natural part of the process.  It's okay to have sad times and moments of pain and weakness. As time progresses however, you can use this pain to build strength.

I encourage all of you that are struggling with racing thoughts and worrying about past/future things to do this. even if only a little everyday. TLDR: Write your feelings and what you did that day and how you felt about it. Even if it's only some odd 30 words.,4,False,False,True,False,3,False," Writing my thoughts is becoming natural, natural to the point of calmness and a feeling of completeness upon finishing said journaling or logging.

  At first, it was rather difficult. Putting my thoughts onto paper took at least 30 minutes of contemplating what to write instead of just, well... writing. after getting over this hurdle, writing becomes a very nice way to pass the time and feels great for the soul. The difference in emotional status is drastic, getting my thoughts onto paper or in any form I can get it in, feels as if I'm hitting the reset button on my emotions. Like I'm talking to someone and that someone is reassuring me, making those negative feelings go away. I'm not educated enough to know as to why that happens when I write, but I'm eternally grateful that it even works that way at all. When I first started writing my feelings about the day, I just did it out of desperation or boredom. But as I kept doing it for a few days, I noticed these changes in how I feel. 

  I really hope this helps whoever is reading this, as it has helped me immensely with getting my emotions and thoughts in order. Peace be upon you and your endeavors.

My argument AGAINST religion. sock it to me,4,False,False,True,False,20,False,"Wow. Lucky you. Lucky you to happen to be born into the correct religion which will surely carry you into the universally desired afterlife. Afterall that is the end goal of life right? To have our souls float into the clouds and spend eternal bliss with our loved ones who have passed before us? What if there is no afterlife? Then all religion is is a strict set of guidelines that restrict our enjoyment of our time on Earth, when in fact time should be the only thing to limit our freedom and autonomy. It has been estimated that throughout the world there are roughly 4,200 religions, all with slightly different but frightfully similar creation and afterlife stories. It is human nature to wonder and seek answers to large scale questions. Due to our natural biases and gravitation towards answers to impossible questions we are pulled towards organized religion as a means of comfort and security for the uncertainty of the world and universe around us. 
	Despite seeking religion as a means of freedom and clinging to the promise of an eternally happy afterlife to have something to live for, following an organized religion restricts and limits our freedom on Earth. The promise of a blissful afterlife is what draws so many to the confines of a religion as it adds meaning to an otherwise meaningless existence (“Why Do We Have Religion Anyway?”). Across the world there are roughly 4,200 religions. Each offering different yet frightfully similar promises of an afterlife next to whatever god or being that is making those compacts with the “holy men” who in turn tell you all about the great prizes that come with abiding by the strict laws and routines of their respected ideology. Hinduism, according to Adam Shirley from Weforum.org, has the third most followers around the world. Hinduism also has well over 330 million gods each catering to a different human desire and necessity. This abundance of deities makes for a comprehensive understanding of the world around those who abide by Hindu scripture. The seemingly unlimited number of gods makes for a clear explanation of each element of human life. If a person claims they are Christian they denounce all 4,200 religions, including the thousands variants of Christianity throughout time and the world except for the individual one which they follow. Furthermore, in each branch of Christianity, there are many slight differences within individual churches and ideological groups. The difference between an atheist or “anti theist” and a Christian is the denial of just one more religion. With such a massive number of churches and sects what are the odds that the one that each of us were born into is correct? 
Was JFK killed by a single, disgruntled man with a cheap rifle, or by a team of elite alien hitmen sent here because they were upset about the faked moon landing, wishing we actually came to see them? Because of the large scale effect of John F. Kennedy being killed in seemingly cold blood, the public had a hard time believing that there was such a small scale cause for the crime. This disbelief in the simple cause of the huge effect is called proportionality bias. Proportionality bias is our natural tendency to seek causes that equal the effect we see explains, Thea Buckley in her article “Why Do Some People Believe in Conspiracy Theories?”. When JFK was killed we could not accept that a single man took the shots as the effect was massive and a single man seems overly simple. In the case of Ronald Reagan being shot it was easily accepted that a single man shot him because Reagan did not die; It was a much smaller effect so a smaller cause justified it well in the eyes of the public. In a similar way the creation of the world we live on and the deep, infinite space around us is the largest comprehensible effect we can see. In turn we cling to the largest scale cause we can find. For so many of us in a civilized nation the largest answer we can find to explain our origins is the God or gods that our beloved religions offer, giving us the insane number of followers in each sect. 
Even in times of doubt of the reality of the gods, religion offers comfort through a community of like minded individuals, which is for many, the reason for remaining in an organized church says David Slusser, a religion teacher at De La Salle. However, according to Joel Runyon from Impossiblehq.com, surrounding yourself with only like minded individuals is very dangerous as it does not allow you to grow as a person as all the questions you can ask will be answered by the group and you are less likely to question the answers you receive. You begin to adopt their hobbies, their beliefs and their viewpoints. Sure, this may not be a bad thing if the people you are following are generally good people with positive habits. Sadly, this inhibits you from formulating your own ideas and thoughts. 
For many who dislike religion the reason is the hypocrisy that many of the followers portray. Meaning they say or preach one thing and in reality do not put their words into practice, openly engaging in “sinful” activities while going to church on sundays or just holidays in order to be forgiven. In reality, the true hypocrisy surrounding religion comes from the fact that while they preach eternal salvation and freedom, in reality following an organized religion does nothing but restrict our freedom or autonomy on Earth. Religion has positives, including improved introspectiveness, a strong sense of community and the feeling of understanding the world around us. However, not only does religion hold us back from achieving our true potential as individuals, but also instills false hope in order to satisfy our human nature. Sigmund Freud says, ""The whole thing is so patently infantile, so foreign to reality, that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life” (Civilization and its Discontents 1930), meaning if you know the reality or the science behind religion, it is truly painful and angering to watch so many around you lose so much potential in their lives to an organized sect. Now that you know the facts about religion, why not get the most out of your life and be self-reliant and create your own moral compass rather than following someone else's, no two people are alike.

Which mental problem am I likely going through?,0,False,False,True,False,6,False,"I am pretty sure I might have some sort of mental problem. Am not sure which one, but am pretty certain that most of my behaviors are not ones that mentally healthy people engage in. These behaviors include:
1) Intense mood swings,not normal ones but going from happy to irrititable to angry to guilty to anxious and then back to happy, usually in the span of a few hours. 
2) I have a short fuse, which might be due to the above. I can hold back it using nothing but will, but the problem is I am not sure when I will run out of patience and snap, which is a problem because I am not only sarcastic and bitter, but sometimes harsh in my anger. I also show signs of physically supressing anger like clenched fists and gritted teeth. I have never taken out my anger pjysically on anyone, but I have been called scary when I am like that, which makes me feel like shit.
3) I have also been feeling like I am becoming more confused and/or idiotic. I keep on changing my thoughts about everything on the flip of a switch. I quickly go from idealising a person to thinking they don't care and then back. It's not just others, I do this to myself too. Not to mention my weird obsession with perfect grammar and order.
4) I also seem to have picked up a bad habit of binge eating and spending more than I used to. It also seems like I am failing at everything.

“Friend group” abandoned me. Made me lose sight of who I am.,2,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I was in an online server with friends that I made for over 6 months. One dude called me delusional and a problem when I asked him for space, then yelled at me infront of others. When I was hurt by this, no one cared or listened. Since they heard his side first, they sided with him, saying I’m the problem for being “sensitive” and now, I am seen as a horrible person.

And when I was talking to a “neutral” person, he wasn’t open minded and very harsh/blunt but not in a thoughtful way. When I tried to explain my mindset on certain topics/ outlooks on life, he’d get hostile and I felt like I’d have to defend myself… he’d then claim I was “passive aggressive” because I didn’t agree with him. and now, he thinks that all the other people are right. Because of one miscommunication and me trying to defend myself.

I was put in a position where, I’m being repeatedly attacked by everyone and no matter what I do, people only see my flaws/mistakes over anything I do.

I know none of this matters, because these people are online and don’t truly know me irl. But having so many people saying I am a bad person and my decisions and feelings are invalid is extremely harmful to my mental health. I don’t know how to handle these emotions.

There is no cure for social anxiety,1,False,False,True,False,11,False,"Social anxiety comes from perceiving social interactions as bad because of the way you FEEL during them. Logic has nothing to do with it, because almost everyone with social anxiety logically knows that social interactions arent as scary as they are. It's all in your feelings and yeah most people might feel a little bit uncomfortable in social situations but they still have control over how they react mentally and physically to these situations, which is why most of them give the same advice like ""it's not as bad as it seems"" or ""just put yourself out there"".

But with people with SA they have a extremely heightened sensitivity to these feelings to the point where it's so unbearable they have absolutely no control over the way they think or behave, there feelings took over thier body and telling themselves it's ""this"" or ""that"" won't do anything because your feelings just override everything you do. Then people might say "" just push through these feelings"" yeah that is possible even though its takes an extraordinary amount of effort everytime you push through it. But even if you do manage to do that there are multiples things that happen in result. People with SA want control over the way they feel and say things and when you push yourself to say something because of your anxiety it becomes noticible in your vibe since most people are relaxed when saying things, and yeah again it's not a bad thing since you at least pushed yourself to do it

But because of anxiety you want everything to be right and flow soomthly and when you're always thinking about whether saying that thing is right or not you kinda forget what you are supposed to say or how to say it. People might say they dont care or notice it. But sometimes they do especially when you ruin the vibe by saying something when the people talking are high energy and extroverted and you're quiet and low energy. So that creates more anxiety and it's just an endless loop of trying to fix yourself.

With anxiety it's practically impossible to improve yourself because these feelings are so strong you can't even tell what rational or not. You become disconnected from reality and this creates more anxiety and depression. And the only way you're gonna improve yourself is by not having anxiety, which we all know you can't really do that. 

People resort to taking drugs to numb thier feelings which actually works, but it's also sad because imagine how strong these feelings are where they would rather become a drug addict and risk harming themselves just because of some stupid anxiety. That's why ssri's make you feel numb. THAT'S A GOOD THING YOU IDIOTS. The numbness motivates you to do something and helps you become more rational in your thinking.

Tl;Dr You can't cure social anxiety because you have no control over your feelings and coping doesn't work because you can't tell what works or not since you are so disconnected from reality because of these feelings. Things that numb you help you but they are short term and you'll have to become reliant on them.",False,False,socialanxiety,401691,Controversial,2019,8,High,1,35,3053,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0
My boyfriend (22M) has PTSD. What would that present like in a person and in a relationship?,9,True,False,True,False,56,False,"Before we got together (22M) and (23F), my boyfriend was diagnosed with PTSD after witnessing a very traumatic event years ago. He was only 18 when it happened. He is very intellectual and aware of his PTSD. His perspective is—*If I can't cure it, I'll learn how to live with it.* He was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Being in a relationship with him has made me curious as to whether there is also something else he may have but was not diagnosed with. I do not want to sound ignorant and want to be supportive therefore I just need to know if what he deals with is due to his PTSD. I am also somewhat aware of C-PTSD but do not have much on that. I only mention this because he witnessed a traumatic event at 18 years old, a very young age.

He has angry outbursts, unable to control his emotions, any little thing will set him off, he's super awkward in social environments, during his emotional outbursts, he'll become reckless and impulsive. Most of the time, he dissociates. Self-destructive behavior, like speeding. Also is incapable of being alone ( I believe this stems from his abandonment-attachment issues ). He also becomes extremely pessimistic and it's impossible to try and uplift him. He often carries this dark cloud on him and it is even starting to weigh me down. During these episodes, he is emotionally abusive. Constantly thinks I am lying, or have other motives. Constantly overthinks everyone and everything. Once he becomes level-headed, has these super overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame, says he is a burden despite my reassurances. When he's depressed, he feels the lowest of the low, almost to the point he has suicidal thoughts but without intent. He recognizes that he suffers from all of this and wishes he was just *normal*. Knowing he feels this way, kills me. When he's hurting, I'm hurting.

When he is not having an episode and life feels steady, he's overcome with happiness and energy. He is super loving. He also tends to get egotistical but that doesn't bother me that much but I do notice it.

This is a never ending cycle, I love him very deeply, and he loves very deeply however the overall tone of the relationship is depressing, like I am walking on egg shells around him constantly because I am afraid something will set him off and put him in a mood. **Does PTSD make someone like this**? **I just want to expand my knowledge because I feel as if there is something more going on here, possibly bipolar disorder. After extensive self-research, I know they can be very easily mixed. I also know that traumatic events can trigger bipolar disorder along with PTSD.**

We are currently on a break because the relationship has taken a mental toll on me. Do not let me shit on him because he is a great and an amazing person, and life has been *very* unfair to him, I have the most patience and love out of anyone I know however it is taking a toll. I want to be there for him...it is not his fault how much trauma he has endured I do not blame him. After my initiation of the break, he decided to book his first appointment to see a therapist since I told him I cannot be his therapist. He also has been off of nicotine for months so I know it's not withdrawals, and he plans on quitting marijuana very soon. He doesn't feel right about being dependent on substances, especially when marijuana makes his anxiety 10x worse. I know PTSD is up there with one of the hardest things to live with, I just want to show love and support without him leeching off of my happiness.

Problematic Attitudes In This Subreddit,0,True,False,True,False,5,False,"disclaimer: I'm not a therapist, psychologist or medical professional.

I think we have a very unhelpful, dismissive, problematic way of addressing people who come to this subreddit wishing to explore their feelings of anxiety. I see this problem not just in this subreddit but in society as a whole and it literally grounds any helpful, healing dialogue to a dead cold ground 0 halt.

Imagine this scenario: Someone says....""Hey guys I feel super anxious around people, I struggle with depression, thoughts of worthlessness..."" etc.

What are they looking for?

1. a space to explore their feelings/ thoughts
2. by exploring feelings/thoughts coming to a deeper understanding of themselves and SA in general.
3. With this new knowledge- being able to decide a new course of action. (Empowerment)
4. community bonding with likeminded people. Knowing you are not the only one. (Validation)

What do they get?

1. ""Bro, they are just feelings""
2. ""Its just brain chemistry bro""
3. ""Its just trauma bro.""
4. ""Its just \[insert mental illness word\] ""
5. ""Bro its just low dopamine/seratonin""etc, combinations of these - you get the idea.

Question: Are you a: therapist, psychologist, neurologist, academic or medical professional to make speculative claims about brain chemistry, hormones, neurotransmitters?

If not. Please kindly STOP with the medicalization of people's ""problems"". It reduces the complexity of people down to one word and one sentence solution.

It's lying.

Why is medicalization of social anxiety problematic?Because when someone comes here to explore the rich and complex interplay of their personality, environment, history and its relationship to social anxiety- there's at least 10 mongs who shut down the healing dialogue process by passing off dangerous and dismissive diagnosis as ""advise"". The OP- then having been confirmed that he is just ""low on seratonin"" basically believes these doctor-wannabe mongs and really has no recourse for action.... What can you do when someone says ""yea you just have low serotonin""?

1. Its invalidating: It implies that what you are feeling is ""wrong"" and an abnormality. No. It's an adaptation. The human self adapts to its environment, its not a random abnormality that just ""happens"". Because its an adaptation there's a cause and effect.  Its not a ""just \_\_\_\_""
2. Its disempowering: It basically tells the person that they are not the source of knowledge of themselves lol. Who else knows you better than yourself? Who can change you but yoursef? You know the saying ""Know they self""? Do you think ""its just feelings/social anxiety/trauma/brain chemistry"" really allows a person to explore their condition in an empowered way? No. It puts all self exploration to a stop.

A better alternative?

1. If you're not interested in having a dialogue with the OP: don't say anything. One sentence explanations are dismissive. They don't help. Stop.
2. If you're interested in the OP: Ask a question. Ask a question about their life- literally anything that strikes your curiosity. This is about two personalities having a talk. Its not a diagnosis. You are not a doctor. You dont need to help.

Actually I should say that again.

\>>> You don't need to help<<<<

People feeling like they should help all the time is the root problem. Just have a conversation with the OP.Why does asking questions help? Because it allows the OP to open up and start thinking about their personality, condition etc. And thinking leads to understanding, which leads to empowerment, choice and so on.

This is literally the basis of talking therapy.

Maybe if we as people knew how to talk and listen better- there'd be less ""mental illness"" in the world.

How about that?

Okay, here's how it is: i'm a 17yearold Swedish guy. For 17 years straight i've had to put up with my fucking awful ADHD father, and my mother is either 1. a general cunt or 2. morphed into a clone of my dad. He doesn't beat me, it's just the little fucking things, he's overly dominant and every day i'm getting picked on, getting tossed around and shit. i am depressed and bipolar, this relates to my relationship issues. I have vented about them in this subreddit before. I help people here all the time, let's hope karma actually works. I don't want to die. If i did i would have killed myself. I'm just empty, that's all. 

In school i very rarely am violent. I say very rarely because ive always gotten picked on, and my mother says ""just walk away"". I have *almost* always done that, and gotten beat up. There has been 4 times in my life when i've finally fucking snapped, and two of those times got me in more trouble. Strangely this never really changed my depression, so i guess feeling something (Yes i admit this sounds cheesy) is better than nothing. I have a few friends, but we don't hang out 24/7. I'm mostly at home in my room behind locked doors. The only way to keep the sanity. 

One more years of being like this... i would probably have to kill him. Let's hope the swedish police is kinder to people who just.... leave. 


Let's bring it up to speed. My computer broke two months ago, and today i got a new one. THe one i got today was crap, since it didn't fucking work. After six hours of constant yabbering from my mother (""IT COST SO FUCKING MUCH"") she forced me to call my brother. My brother basically called me a retard and said something along the lines of ""OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK,FUCKTARD - YOU BROKE IT ALREADY"". He pissed me off, i yelled at my mother to just change it in the store (she wouldn't have any of that) my dad fucking yells at me THROUGH THE FUCKING HOUSE(!) saying that i should **""TAKE A FUCKING PILL MOTHERFUCKER""** and that's it folks.


**I ran.** I ran into the door that's before my front door, shattered something (either porcelaine or a window, i didn't see) and i ran. I ran with no shoes. I ran in my socks into town. Mind you, i live in the county almost. I ran to my friend's house. He wasn't there. I ran to my other, more favorite friend, he was at home. He asked me what was wrong and i just shrugged and said ""not now."" so he let me sit down with him while he played some MMORPG game for half an hour, and he let me stay on his couch. That's pretty much it. **I will tell him what's up tomorrow, i just felt i needed to vent it here first, on a throwaway.**


This is a bit more of asking for practical advice rather than professional. ""Call the cops"" isn't what i'm looking for, i'm looking for what i should **do**. Like, do i just run and run and run until i drop dead? i mean, that sounds effective, but not so... charming. Do i fuck over my dad? Will i be able to be at home without my parents? With my stuff? Be safe and sane for once?

Been way too burnt out..,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I feel like before a year ago, almost two now, I had everything in control. A good job, decent finances - it wasn’t completely perfect because of complicated living situations and needing to move out cause of my narcissistic mom and her bf at the time, but I managed.

To make an extremely long novel short, it wasn’t until April of last year when everything sorta fell apart and it hasn’t gotten better. One day my mom left me a voicemail of her shrieking and screaming she was dying that saw me crippling with fear and rushing from one city to the next in an Uber to make sure she was alive.

Having a relationship with relationship-orientated PTSD,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I have ptsd from a previous relationship, I don't want to go into details but the result is that I'm unable to do anything sexual without bursting into tears. I'm currently having EMDR I've been with my current partner for 2 years, for the last 6 months we've not had sex at all - my initial response to the trauma was to be hypersexual, but gradually this turned into shame and fear. I dont know whether this is a normal thing to happen.

This has made me really confused. I use to be so sex positive (prior to abuse) and now I have so much shame around sex. I can't even really think about what happened. I dont know if I'll ever feel better. My attitudes around sex and relationships are changing during the treatment, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but will surely impact my relationship. For a period, I thought I might be totally gay - I'm bi but have typically dated men. 

I've also started having feelings for someone I work with - it's an obsessive feeling that I've had before and I know it's not healthy. I've not acted on it at all because I recognise that it's stemming from somewhere else. I want to spend time with him and talk to him as much as possible. He's not expressed romantic interest and neither have I - nothing will happen between us but a part of me wants something to. But this confuses me too. Why am I fantasising about him like this? I think he values me as a person, not as someone to sleep with. He's a respectful person that I trust and feel safe with, so maybe thats related. But I trust my partner too? 

My partner wants to get married and buy a house soon (both 25). Ive smiled and nodded along but treatment is making me realise that I minimise how I feel and what I want - I know I'm not ready for these things. He wants kids, I don't know if I do. I asked him not to propose last year because there's too much going on. He's been very supportive and seems happy to wait. The relationship generally is good.

I love him but I don't know whether we should be together. I'm debating ending things so that I can figure myself out.

I (16 M) have been dealing with emotional detachment for about 4-5 years. Now, it’s not all black and white or linear.

For the past 4-5 years I would get into these episodes where I would be so hyper and do so much and then I would hit a roadblock so bad where I could not even concentrate. That is also the case for this year. The thing that worries me the most is that in the past I would literally feel detached from my feelings. It was like there was a box of my feelings attached to a string which was then attached to me. I knew how I should feel but it’s like no matter how hard I tried I was cold. I was not numb. It was like I was a robot and felt nothing at all. No empathy, no remorse, no happiness, no sadness, nothing.

Now this year, it’s a bit different. I have a girlfriend (17 F) who I absolutely adore. It’s the healthiest relationship i’ve ever been in considering my past relationship was very abusive and toxic. 

This year, I got in the same mood where I would get very hyper and complete everything I needed to then crash. The only difference is i’m trying really hard to not go into the next step which I know is where i detach from my emotions. My Gf has picked up on my coldness a bit and it scares me. When i get into that state it is so hard to break out of it. She’s been able to help me snap back into my normal self the last two times I went “cold” but i’m trying really hard because I don’t want to hurt her.

Is there a name for this anxiety?,21,False,False,True,False,17,False,"I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$& out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i  have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this: 

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

Physical PTSD symptoms?,2,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Trigger warnings for discussion about SH and emotional abuse and physical threatening 

Hi! So i’ve recently been diagnosed with PTSD, this is due to moments with my father where he put me in a situation where I felt I had to physically defend myself or where he threatened to hit me, not ideal, but not the most horrible causes of PTSD.

At times it can really feel overwhelming. It’s not something I experience in any other way and the only way I can describe it is that I can just feel the trauma being processed/rejected in my brain.

Anxiety & Depression Turned My Brain To Mush,84,False,False,True,False,10,False,"I've been suffering from anxiety since I was 5 it made my life a living hell, when I was 16 I found out about anxiety, but I always ignored that idea, and I always thought I was just being a baby and overthinking and overreacting about a lot of things. I told myself to be like the other kids at school and push past that, but I never could. I realized at the age of 16 as well that my happiness/ joy was decreasing slowly each year, as I was getting older everything was getting less exciting and I thought that was something normal for people as they grow up, and at the age of 20, I decided to go to the doctors and they diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Inattentive ADD, and Clinical Depression. After about a year of trying medications from a regular doctor then to a psychiatrist nothing worked the only thing that came close to helping a bit was the stimulant medication, but that didn't last because I'm highly tolerant to any medications. They then sent me to a specialist who wanted to try Transcranial Magnetic Therapy on me. but sadly the drive was 1 hour away and I would have had to go everyday for 6 weeks for therapy and that just wouldn't have been possible, and now I'm extremely discouraged because this has affected my life so badly that at this point.

Help with sticking up for myself and speaking up,2,False,False,True,False,2,False,"I need help
    I used to be a social butterfly when I was a kid. That is until middle school... I skipped 3rd grade and went to a small private Christian school for 4th and 5th grade. Then returned to public school for 6th grade. Things were going okay at first. But I quickly started to fail. So my schedule was switched....6 times within that first half year.

And I developed extreme social anxiety. 
     I've overcome some of that anxiety but not all. I HATE conflict. Or arguments. And I don't stick up for myself. Someone could literally talk straight garbage to my face and I do nothing at all. Like, my heart pounds! I'm like a scared little puppy; tail tucked between its legs and cowering. 
I just try to ""keep the peace"" and never say anything that could be conflicting. And it sucks tbh. I feel like people walk all over me. 
   So I guess my question is, how can I overcome this fear? And learn how to ""snap back"" when people push me around? I'm so tired of being super sensitive.

So I told her that I suffer from ADHD and PTSD, and neither of those are an excuse for laziness.  Welp, if I didn't paint a target on my back. All of a sudden I'm getting extra work on my schedule. There was a 4 day work week, with PTO the following Monday, where I arrived to work being told that we need you to run these 4 tests in two days and get us the data before your PTO. They never asked me if I could handle this task. Instead they asked my coworker if it was doable for someone to run 2 of these tests in one day and have the data in before someone were to go on PTO. My coworker told them that it was possible to run the two methods in one day but getting the data would take at least a day and a half for the two-test days. Well since it takes this coworker 4 hours to get one of the two tests on, it should be no problem for me to do two of the tests in 8 hours. And since coworker said a day and an half for data, boss will give me just a day to process each double run. I was set up for failure. This isn't the first time this has happened! The continuous micromanagement and the constant comparison of perceived time frames only lead to more gaslighting and sabotage! It's sad when your own coworkers look over your schedule and tell your boss this amount of work isn't even possible for them to do.  (Them being a subject matter expert).

But again I am not trained in the other test nor have I even looked at the test procedure until today. Doesn't matter. We need you to run this.

I think my therapist is attracted to me...,4,True,False,True,False,19,False,"I got diagnosed with severe PTSD when I was 19. Cptsd a few years later. I always had horrific luck with therapists, to the point I figured therapy would be pointless since it was so hard to talk about things.



After things finally blew up more than they ever have last year, I had just gotten into the therapist I have now. I only heard about EMDR through my better half, who was a military vet and went through more intense treatment back when he came back. We searched high and low for someone to do EMDR, the only person we found was shitty. Then somehow this one popped up  It was a miracle. The guy I found was a sports psychologist (the only one I ever felt connected with was that, it helps a lot to be able to connect that.) 

Hes my age, (late 20s/early 30s) were into similar stuff, we both do jiu jitsu, and although theres a boundary there, I dont feel like I'm a mental patient with someone with a holier than thou attitude that just sits and makes me talk. I legit talk to him like hes one of my friends, making it way easier for me to open up and trust him. It's almost required for me. (Doctors trigger the crap out of me) I think because of the similar interests, the fact that most my friends are guys and he knows how to talk to me and play off my thoughts. 


Anyways, he's married. Dont get me wrong hes a somewhat ish good looking guy, but again, married and I'm beyond happy with the one I have. He (the guy I'm with) my best friend and battle buddy. But over time, I've caught little things here and there, some major things that led me to believe he might have a thing for me. I honestly wasnt paying attention until I was doing a telehealth session that day and as we were finishing up some of my guy friends were saying how obvious it was he was flirting with me. I didnt believe them until time after time things became a bit more in my face.


The first time I noticed was when I talk about the guy I'm with, he gets weird. (Most times it's fine, I think, because I'm there for therapy. I'm not always paying attention.) Anyway he was surprising me with a trip, I had no clue where, that was his thing. I was super excited, and you'd think most therapists would say something like, ""oh that'll be fun! I hope you have a good time"" or something like that. He instead, paused while looking down, and was kind of condescending toward him saying, ""watch him take you to Nebraska or something..."" and I'm like uh...no? He said a beach?... (that was maybe three months into it. I've been in it for 10 and no comments have popped up like that again)


But I've also noticed the body language, the way he looks at me which I'll be honest sometimes resembles how the guy I'm with does. The same shit a guy does when hes into you, that's what he's doing. Sometimes I wont notice anything for a while. But then sometimes it'll really hike up. There was even a point I noticed he didnt wear his wedding ring...coincidence? I hope so. 

On telehealth sessions my video doesnt automatically pop on, but his does, so I can see his screen before he can see me. I've noticed him fixing his hair, and even once staring at what would clearly only be my profile picture.

Hes never said anything about it, thankfully, and that's about as far as its gotten. I dont, at least I dont think, its gotten in the way of my progress?

I really hope I'm reading too much into it. Because I'm there for therapy and I'm afraid to lose this therapist because it's the only one I ever feel like has ever helped me.

"I think anxiety is making me lose weight, which is making me more anxious! (cycle)",3,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi All, 28M, So firstly, I am a big hypochondriac, and dealt with Health anxiety for 7 years up and down.

I normally have coasting or 'background worries' and never seem to lose weight (though I rarely use to jump on the scales) but recently my anxiety has increased as of Jan, health related worries and other issues due to my partner going through some dark times.

**October 2023** I was 17st 3lbs, whilst from this point we decided to eat healthier and cut out a lot of shit / making meals from whole foods less processed, I feel I still eat a lot and do very little exercise, 

End of **November** I was 16st 9, **Xmas** back up to 16st 12lbs, Now **Feb 12th 2024** down to as low as 16st 5, I've tried to be consistent with my weighing times relative to the first time, as I don't really weigh myself in mornings (I should :/)

My S.O (28F) has been on similar eating habits / exercise than me and has hardly lost any weight!

But now I'm worried I have some awful cancer or disease causing this

Note: I had routine bloodwork in December all came back normal CBC, liver, thyroid etc, Stool sample / calprotien (for IBD) all normal

My doctor recently said diet changing can slowly reduce weight even without exercise and similar food intake, he isn't worried but has agreed to re-check 4 weeks.

When I gave you my son, he was a young, healthy boy. He didnt have nightmares, he didnt have back problems. He didnt have a shoulder that is going to have to be surgically repaired. He did not have 2 major blows to the head in IED attacks, one of which required surgery in Bahgram. He had never missed a Christmas with his family, He had never had to shoot at anyone. He never had nightmares. He could walk into the convenience store and not have to worry about people getting too close behind him in line. I could open a can of biscuits without warning him to leave the room. He could hear out of his left ear. He was engaged in life, he laughed , he cried, he cared about his family. 

What you sent me back, LOOKS like my son, but is terribly broken. To top it off, your VETERANS system is also so broken, that 10 months after being discharged from the Army under HONORABLE CONDITIONS MIND YOU....the boy cannot take care of his family because he is broken. You want him to jump through your hoops to prove how broken he is, so you set up appointments for him to come to the VA hospital. This is a 50 mile one way drive for him, in his mothers car because he couldnt afford to pay for his and it got repossessed. Then he shows up and with NO NOTIFICATION his appointment has been cancelled. He cant start school because the GI Bill money is MONTHS behind. 

Meanwhile, THIS combat Veteran is lucky to have a family that supports him, and by support I mean LITERALLY his brothers, his sister and his parents pay his bills so he can eat and have a roof over his head.

You used him for whatever purpose you needed and then threw him back into a society that, while TRYING to be supportive, has no idea what he has been through or what he is going through. It is a terrible reflection on ""the system"" and heartbreaking to watch. Shame on you. Shame.

Feminism makes me want to die,0,False,False,True,False,79,True,"Reading about feminism or speaking with pro-feminist people makes me want to die. It's not an exaggeration and not a joke. I'm not trolling you.

Sometimes feminists [say directly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html) that I should hate myself. But even without explicit misandry, the feminist theory is full of things that make me feel very bad about myself and sometimes even doubt my own sanity. Sometimes I feel like it pushes me to the conclusion I shouldn't deal with women at all because I'm dangerous to them. Every step I take is a potential danger to women.

I have a long history of mental health issues and sometimes I feel that dealing with feminism is too much for me. Feeling like I'm constantly accused, directly and indirectly, and then being gaslighted (*""no, feminism doesn't accuse you, it only fights for equality""*) is too much for me.

One of the things I hate most about feminist theory is the concept of objectification. This concept is very fuzzy, unclear, indistinct. The line between accepted nudity and objectification is blurred up to the point of non-existence, which I often perceive as shaming me for my sexuality. I've spent days, weeks, and months trying to understand this concept and I do understand some of its manifestations, but often it is interpreted in a way I perceive as shaming me for the fact that I am sexually attracted to female bodies.

A few days ago I made a post about this in a mental health sub, and some people suggested I was a troll. Some of them behaved in a way that suggested I didn't understand something obvious. It makes me either feel stupid or doubt whether I'm sane.

What helps me to some extent to feel better is deliberately refraining from reading anything about feminism or talking with pro-feminist people. But sometimes it's difficult because pro-feminist people are everywhere. Seeing things like a post by a mental health resource mentioning ""toxic masculinity"" may start these doubts again. Yes, it often takes place in the form of doubts: should I hate myself? Should I feel ashamed for liking female bodies in advertisements? Maybe I don't understand something? Maybe I'm stupid? Is feminism right? Or are MRA right?

What also helps me (though it's to some extent the opposite of the previous) is reading and participating in MRA groups. But it makes me feel very, very uncomfortable to see how the men's rights movement is unfairly radicalized in society. One person in a mental health sub saw my profile and said they think I'm *""being radicalized in real time""*. When I hear something like that, I start doubting my own sanity. Because I don't understand why the MRM subs where I participate are radical. I see much more radical things in feminist groups.

Seeing [people who feel the way I do](https://archive.ph/0H2gL) also helps me. I feel not alone.

MRA subs is one of the things that helped me not to have suicidal thoughts from dealing with feminism for a few months. But today it happened again when I saw this:

*""The over-sexualization of the female breast is a danger to us. The censorship of the “female” nipple is a danger to us.""*

Such things honestly make me feel like I want to die. Something is wrong with the fact I find female breasts sexually attractive. It's not natural, it's been imposed by society. And it's harmful to women. I should stop being attracted to them. Or stop dealing with women. Or die.

Being shamed for such basic things as your sexual attraction is very, very painful.

Do I remember anything similar from my childhood? Probably yes, but it was much smaller. In my teen years, I constantly received messages like *""all men want is to have sex""* and ""*women are not interested in sex as much as men""*, which made a contribution to my fear of girls. Such messages made me feel dirty and guilty about my sexual desires. I always felt like I shouldn't show girls my sexual interest, because it could repulse them. Also, there was another kind of shaming — kind and tender feelings toward girls (and people in general) were disapproved by other boys.

Feminism contributes to my shame of sexual desires and reinforces it. It promotes the same message I received in childhood: women don't like it when men see them as sexually attractive.

Now I want to say a few things to avoid common accusations:

1. No, I'm not far-right. I'm not even conservative. My political views are liberal.
2. No, I don't hate women. I LOVE THEM. Seems like feminism is telling me there is something wrong with my attraction to them.
3. No, I'm not afraid to ""lose my male privilege"", because I don't feel privileged. I'm an unmarried and currently unemployed man with a chronic mental disorder.
4. No, I don't have anything against women in high management positions. I wouldn't mind if my government was 50% female or even 100% female.
5. No, don't feel ""entitled to sex"". But I do feel sexually frustrated, which is very, very painful.
6. No, this post is not a manifestation of my ""toxic masculinity"". I think I'm closer to the opposite pole — I'm rather androgynous, shy, and extremely unconfident in real-life social situations.

I'm planning to post this in a few subs — suicide support, MRA, and probably somewhere else. If you are not going to say anything constructive or supportive, please don't say anything. I have had enough comments that were the opposite of constructiveness or supportiveness, so I don't have to worry about keeping balance to be objective. Please don't say anything like *""don't act in a degrading manner towards women""*, because I never do such things and I'm not inclined to such behaviour. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about sexualized images of women and my desire in general, which I feel is being shamed.

How seriously suicidal am I? Not to the point of planning to kill myself today, but enough to the point that if one day I kill myself, one of the reasons may be the things I described above. I hope the moderators of MRM subs where I'm planning to post this won't find my post inappropriate. It's not suicidal ideation or incitement to suicide.

And you are trying to heal by unconsciously accepting relationships that keep replicating the same trauma bond over and over again, hoping this time you can fix it. 

But here is the lightbulb moment. 

It's not about fixing THEM. That is their healing journey. You got to figure out what it is in YOU that feels so lost, broken, incomplete... and heal that first. You have to rebuild your internal foundations, work on creating new goals for yourself, work on learning about wellbeing and personal happiness.

Is this self-handicapping or is it a real connection?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi,

Sorry for the no post history and age of my account. I just made this throwaway. I’m writing on here because I have no one else to talk about this with in my life right now. 

I am 26F with little dating history/experience. I’ve dated a few guys here and there but only for a few months at a time. Usually they turn out to be completely the wrong person for me. Just for dating context. 

About 4 years ago I recognized I really had the desire to date someone and for a long term relationship. Especially as I’ve never experienced this before. Never been in love, etc. 

Every few months I go on dating apps to give it a real shot. It never usually goes well. To be honest, I have very specific passions and interests, and it’s important for me to share these passions with my partner. So the guys on the dating apps, just seem… boring to me, when they don’t share these interests. It’s an obscure interest. (Can’t share bc of doxxing).  

Online dating is not easy for me. I usually try to talk with people to schedule a date, but they usually stop talking to me shortly after matching. I am a real catch in real life, so it is disappointing to me.   

A couple of weeks ago I was using the apps trying to meet men to hopefully get to know and date. A guy popped up that, let’s just say, couldn’t put photos of himself online because he was born and raised in a nearby cult and couldn’t risk being identified. We get talking because I love what he writes on his profile, we have unique shared interests/passions, and I’m intrigued. 

We start talking via chat and voice note. The more we talk, the more I realize how incredible this guy is. 

The problem? He is married to an abusive wife and has several kids through a poorly arranged marriage when he was a teen. 

Now when I first found this out, in my head I was like obviously this is never going to work for me, I want several kids of my own one day. If he leaves his wife and the cult, he will probably be cut off from his kids, but will have to pay child support. We are talking multiple kids here. I don’t want to give numbers for privacy.

He is not indoctrinated in any way and recognizes how terrible his life is because of this cult. He was forced to have children as a child - he literally had no say in the matter. Like I said, it is a cult. Brainwashing, isolation, lack of education, etc. However, he somehow turned out to be the most intelligent, courageous, and free minded person I’ve ever met. His character is a testament to his soul, and I’m in awe at who he is after everything he’s been through. 

I’m finding myself at a terrible crossroads. We only met a few weeks ago, so it’s too early to tell if it’s true love, etc. But as we keep talking, this connection is really growing. I will be telling him that he can’t leave the cult for me, but only on his own accord, as I could never handle the gravity of that decision. What if we broke up? He can’t leave for only me. But to be honest, he wants to leave for so many reasons - all having to do with his life, experiences, and mental and physical health, and spiritual beliefs. 

My concern is that I’m self handicapping. I find this guy so amazing, so miraculous, and our compatibility and admiration for each other is undeniable. I’m sad because he’s a regular guy that’s been trapped in this terrible cult his whole life. And now he has many kids which will always be a part of him and would take away resources if we had a family one day. Not to mention, he will have no family because they cut him off. It’s just a lot. 

I say self handicapping because I’m generally afraid of rejection from other bachelors that I find suitable. I try dating, but I’ve been waiting to find Mr. Right at the right place and the right time. 

But with this guy, I feel so seen, validated, cherished, and compatible in a way I’ve never experienced before. It feels like it’s all happening for a reason.

Severe interview anxiety,1,True,False,True,False,1,False,"*Trigger warning: brief mention of desire to harm self*

I’m a college graduate c/o 2021. I worked for 1 year post grad. I’m going on nearly 2 years of unemployment because I can’t interview.

Late 2022, I was flown out by 2 major companies for final interviews in the industry I’m in (or was, I guess?) and ditched the interviews the morning of both times. One of the companies I was interviewing with was my dream job. I fumbled an opportunity with my dream job. 

I was depressed for months after ditching— like the type of depression where you don’t get out of bed for days, drinking heavily yet discreetly, not eating, barely taking care of myself. The interviews were scheduled a few weeks apart, and skipping the first interview really destroyed my confidence in my skills to communicate. It still makes me emotional thinking about it. I didn’t tell anyone the full details of what happened for about a year, including my parents. I just told them that I didn’t get the job.

Strong education and subsequently landing a good, fulfilling job is a fundamental pillar in my family. I’m the oldest daughter of immigrant parents and I failed the expectations that they’d help me develop for myself based on my interests and skills. They forwent so many comforts and pleasures for me. My mom’s entire salary was spent sending me (and my sister) to get quality private education (we both had extremely generous donors and scholarships K-12, but the remaining balance still took a lot from them financially). I failed myself, but it also hurts badly still to know that I failed them in achieving our shared dreams for myself.

My resume and experiences were very strong post grad. I had a lot of confidence and interest in the previous work I’ve completed. However, for both interviews, I was required to present technical presentations and meet with a panel (Company A with a few panels totaling to 12 PhDs, Company B requiring 4 separate interviews with different teams and one HR group interview). The job I held post grad was with Company A, for which I was applying to a much higher level role. I had left my first role amicably. Company B was my opportunity to sell myself for my dream role. I had the interview with Company B first.

I was unable to sleep the night before both interviews. I had tried preparing for days prior to the interview with Company B and almost 2 weeks prior with Compamy A, but anytime I tried working on my presentation or questions, my muscles would start convulsing involuntarily, id have nausea, shortness of breath, and grow severely overwhelmed. I continually procrastinated the prep to the flight and to my hotel the night before both times, by which point all of these symptoms had ramped up 100 notches. I stayed up the whole night trying to prepare both times.

By 3-5am, I was in tears on a hotline the morning before the Company B interview. I was so scared with what calling out would convey professionally. Specifically with Company A, since I had already left my old position and was currently unemployed, I felt as if being a no show was essentially burning a bridge with the only full time professional opportunity I’ve held. I felt fucked. I was ill prepared, panicking, fatigued, and literally moments away from jumping out the window until the hotline representative spent about 1.5 hours calming me down and convincing me I could go home and I’ll be okay. An hour or two before both interviews, before I’d called out, still trying to push throw and just simply show up, I was vomiting bile, sweating incessantly, still shaking/muscularly convulsing in the hands and legs, could barely breath, couldn’t think straight

This all might sound so dramatic, but these two experiences have prevented me from ever interviewing since then. I didn’t even apply to a single job until a year later (late fall/ early winter 2023) because of the fear that I’d be invited to an interview.

It’s come to the point where I’ve depleted my savings and decided to just try applying to low barrier to entry jobs (retail, food, hospitality) to reup my savings. The search process started this past November. I had an interview with a retail business. I cancelled the day of because I was petrified. I'll browse job boards sometimes to make myself feel like I'm being productive these days and doing something to better my life. In the odd chance I do apply and, if I get an interview invite for the non career related jobs, I just don't respond anymore. I dog sit in my parents’ home that I still live in as a nearly quarter century aged individual to get by, making probably less than minimum wage in my high cost of living state

I've gone to therapy over this. Two therapists, but they both genuinely sucked. One would try to get me to ground myself by counting 5 things I see, 4 things I smell, 3 things I hear… instead of just letting me cry it out during sessions.

I just realized I have experienced a fair amount of emotional trauma.,0,False,False,True,False,14,False,"I have lived with my parents for practically my entire life and I am 28. I have developed an eating disorder that has crippled my ability to digest food. I have experienced extreme desolation and loneliness for years and all the depression and anxiety that's been a part of it. 

The thing is most of my trauma is non-specific. There aren't really any specific events which it derives itself from. It's more of a deep alienation from humanity over a long period of time. I have had a little trouble with drugs, with LSD and marijuana, and I can definitely point to some of the bad experiences on both those drugs to affecting my mind states. And I have had a couple experiences with other people that I might be able to say were traumatic, but not in a really concrete or definite way.

What has been almost most traumatic is the reaction to the trauma. My eating disorder was violent and pretty disgusting. It involved lots of binge eating to the point of agony, but never any vomiting. The details are horrifying probably to most people that isn't familiar with this kind of stuff, and I am not going to go into them, but I can say that this was also a kind of trauma.

Because there's no traumatic event, my life over the past seven years has been a blur splotched with nightmares. I am not by nature a very apathetic person, and I love laughing and enjoying life. But I think a lot and a lot of the world really depresses me... but I have essentially been depressed for all my adult life.

Actually, some of the most painful experiences I can remember are during my travels. I have done some hitchhiking through the US and slept wherever I got dropped off. Some of the nights, usually half sleepless, were extremely painful and lonely. Hitchiking itself is a really painful experience to go through because the mass of cars that pass you by and the lack of humanity really got to me. It has really scared me. 

I'm just trying to understand how this works in healing it, because it is so vague and non specific. I know that all I need is some love and to be able to share something with someone in a mutual way... but I am not sure how to go about that. I've had counseling before but I can't afford an actual therapist and actually I'm not very interested in one... right now, at least, I just want to be able to start recognizing the symptoms of this trauma and how on a daily basis I can begin to work through it.

How do you combat a dissociative disorder?,0,False,False,True,False,17,False,"A couple of months ago, I tried a very small portion, maybe a fifth, of a Delta 8 gummy. I was alone in my room, watching South Park. It didn't hit me for two hours. When it did hit me, I was dozing off, but suddenly I was knocked into the realization that my state of mind was not normal. My movements were in intervals, if that makes sense. I don't remember grabbing my phone or opening up messages, but I remember everything spinning and texting my friend ""IM HIGH"". Everything was cut off from reality, if that makes sense, and it terrified me. I should mention I have an anxiety disorder. Naturally, I was freaking out. I didn't like how I felt as if I had no control over my actions. After a couple of hours of freaking out, the feeling subsided and I went to bed. I thought I would never try this again, but decided to try it once more with one of my best friends. I thought company would help the experience be much more enjoyable. However, I was wrong. What I was feeling was freaking me out. It was that same feeling that there was no transitions between my actions, and that reality was distorted. The only thing that brought me some sense of comfort was to remain still and focus on the TV. I was literally vibrating from how nervous I was. After a sloowwww couple of hours, though, I was brought back to reality and I fell asleep. After this experience, I was convinced that it just wasn't for me; and that's okay. However, that wasn't the end of the terror. In the past week or so, I have been waking up in the middle of the night with the weird cut off from reality feeling.

Treatment resistant: What meds should I still give a try next?,1,False,False,True,False,3,False,"Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.

The social anxiety is one of the biggest sources of my depression and personal main issues. SAD causes me to not go out, not experience anything or new things, not meet people, not socialize, not getting real friends or romantic relationships. By that it kills my self esteem, future perspectives and mood/will to live longer. These were just some examples but all the restrictions you can think of caused by SAD are big contributors to my depression & self esteem. 

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot of daily pain from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment when I close my eyes and lay in be to sleep. I got on Mirtazapine after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad, almost dumb, many people ask me if I have ADHD because of my bad focus and memory. 

Side info: I always wanted to test for ADHD as Methylphenidate (tried of a friend) improved my symptoms significantly but my previous docs didn‘t want to test me for ADHD (in my case rather ADD) 1. before my depression/anxiety isn‘t treated as these two can be the cause of ADHD symptoms and 2. because one needs to be diagnosed for AD(H)D in his childhood for treatment. So I just thought I‘d never be able to get test or treatment for ADD (which I really fell like having in addition to the depression and social anxiety).

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. 

Meds to try next I was Thinking about:
Nefazodone
Clomipramine
Vortioxetine
Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
Selegiline 
Prozac (Fluoxetine - Idk surely as no serotonergic worked so far)
Lamotrigine (or any other antipsychotics, because maybe I‘m wrongly diagnosed as all these 13 meds of antidepressants I tried didn‘t work)
Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, so quit but maybe I just need more time?)


Meds I already tried:
* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin

Use What You Have (106),0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"It starts with feeling what your passion is. It then starts with realizing that you may initially set high goals that want to be achieved when we all start with 0.

Saying to ourselves ""I will start when I have this........"" ""I will start when I have the space........."", has you already lost the game even before starting your first practice. 

**Use what you have.** 

The objects, the space, the **DRIVE** inside. Use what you have and keep using it until you then pivot into getting what you want. 

Comparing to others who have already ""made it"", is such a useless aspect of starting a new craft, new path, new passion, new hobby because that literally makes no sense?

If you are going to compare yourself **(which I hope will be less and less with time)**, then compare yourself with someone else who is in the same position as you. It doesn't have to be someone else with the same focus but start at 0 with someone else who is starting at 0.

Focus daily. Do 1 thing daily towards your new path, new passion and tell yourself that with every step forward, you are moving, progressing. 

**You are well on your way.**

**I love you.**

14 Best self-care tips that improve mental health & wellbeing,92,False,False,True,False,10,False,"Practicing self-care is more essential than ever when it comes to taking care of our emotional health and well-being amid tough changes,

Are you feeling a little under-self-cared-for? Many things can get in the way of us taking care of ourselves, including family caregiving responsibilities, work, social commitments, and more.

But, ultimately, when we do take care of ourselves and our needs is when we’re best able to show up for all of the other people and responsibilities in our lives.

Focusing on what makes us feel nourished and what gives us meaning is part of comforting the feelings of stress and anxiety and giving us a more solid foundation.

Here are some self-care tips for the purpose of inspiring your health & wellness — while helping you feel less stressed and more relaxed.

**1. Prioritize Sleep — Your Mood and Immune System Are depending on It**

When it comes to taking care of your health and well-being, sleep is pretty much always part of the answer. Getting enough good-quality sleep keeps your immune system running at its best to fight off infections. Scientists know sleep is also one of the top ways we can help keep stress in check & at a minimum, as sleep deprivation can make us more sensitive to the effects of stress, ramping up our reactions (or overreactions). The brain needs sleep in order to function; without it, you’ll be less patient and focused, make poor decisions, and be more moody, irritable, and emotional.

**2. Know Your Personal Signs of Stress**

Sometimes self-care is about knowing when you’re getting overloaded or overwhelmed and responding with micro habits that prevent all-out burnout.

For example, are you starting to withdraw from friends? Are you sitting in traffic swearing? Getting more headaches or stomach aches lately? this is learning from what you consider to be your overwhelmed “emoji” key. (We all have a unique one that resonates with us, right?) When you feel the need to text that emoji to everyone on your contact list, take it as a cue to ask yourself what you need. Maybe you need to roll your shoulders a few times and then go take a short walk. It’s about building up awareness and having the self-knowledge to check in and adjust.

**3. Work. It. Out. Burn off that negative energy & ballshit**

Spending a lot more time at home does not mean you get to be a couch potato. Staying active keeps your body healthy physically, keeping your risk of chronic health issues. It also boosts your sense of well-being. Exercise releases endorphins (hormones that make you feel good!), sharpens focus, and aids sleep. Staying physically active also lessens the risk of mood disorders, increases energy, and improves mood overall. Feel mad or angry? take it out on a punching bag, it will feel great.

**4. Test-Drive a Workout You’ve Never Done Before**

When it comes to fitness, people have a tendency to stick to what they know. But this might be the perfect time to hop outside of your comfort zone — while you’re still in the comfort of your home. That way, you may feel less awkward or like a newbie, while getting the benefits of joining a new online class. Check out options like Zumba, boxing, or dance workouts; or download apps that have a range of options.

Are you a yogi or have you considered starting a yoga practice? Now is the time. Yoga offers a laundry list of health benefits, from busting stress to stretching out inactive muscles to building strength to providing a burst of physical activity (depending on the type you do). Why might yoga be an especially useful tool to add to your coping arsenal right now? It links movement with breath. Because both factors can affect the body’s stress reactions, yoga can be a silver bullet in tough times.

**5. Take a Forest Bath**

The Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing,” simply means walking in an area amongst trees and deeply inhaling the air. Trees release certain chemicals, like terpenes, that have been associated with the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which sends your body into “chill-out” de-stress mode. The practice is so powerful that forest bathing has been shown to decrease measures of depression, according to research published in June 2019 in Environmental Health and Preventative Medicine.

**6. Avoid Mindless Snacking; Eat Intuitively Instead**

Are you spending your days within eyeshot or at arm’s reach of your snack drawer? Rather than self-impose strict rules on what foods are off-limits, try intuitive eating. It’s not a diet so much as a way of eating that’s all about giving your body what it needs when it needs it. Intuitive eating doesn’t restrict any specific foods or have you counting calories. It’s a practice in which you listen to your body and pay attention to what you need in the moment. Is it time for a meal or a snack? You eat when you feel hungry, and you stop eating when you feel full.

**7. Swap Out One Coffee for Decaf**

Caffeine is one of the most researched substances, with more than 10,000 studies to date, according to a review published in 2017 in Food and Chemical Toxicology. That’s led to a wide range of conclusions, but one that’s fairly consistent is that having too much can lead to less-than-ideal effects, researchers conclude. They note that getting more than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily can affect your central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and sleep quality. Check your consumption and remember that not every cup of coffee is equivalent when it comes to caffeine content, it depends on the roast of coffee and how strongly it’s brewed. Too much caffeine can even increase anxiety and stress. So, enjoy your buzz, but try limiting your daily amount.

**8. Stress decreasing foods.**

Yes, you read that correctly. Certain foods can actually have a stress-lowering effect. Warm foods like soup or tea are soothing, and the omega-3s in fatty fish may improve mood. Avocados are packed with vitamins C and B6, which are known to help reduce stress. Dark chocolate is antioxidant-rich, which is great for thwarting stress. Other foods that can help include whole-grain carbohydrates, bananas, oranges, water, and leafy greens.

Though you may be inclined to indulge in treats or your favourite cocktail, know that this may be counterproductive. Foods that exacerbate or mess with stress in a less-than-savory way include caffeine, alcohol, and refined sugars. You don’t have to cut them out completely but do limit your intake and enjoy them in moderation.

**9. Develop a ‘Don’t Do’ List**

Self-care doesn’t have to be an action item. It can be about freeing up space for the things that matter in your life and removing those that cause bad energy. After an especially draining day, take a few minutes to reflect: What dragged you down? How can you do less of that? Go ahead and physically write down a “don’t do” list, something that can serve as a reminder that holds you accountable.

This list helps you get unstuck. You may not get this perfect the first time, but you can keep making adjustments until you’re doing more of the things that perk you up.

**10. Make Time for a Massage**

Just 10 minutes of shoulder massage may be enough to increase relaxation, decrease stress, and improve heart rate variability, reports a study which published in September 2020 in the journal Scientific Reports. Heart rate variability is the measure of the variation in time between heartbeats, according to Harvard Health Publishing; better Heart rate variability signals that your nervous system is in a calming rest-and-digest mode, rather than a stressed-out fight-or-flight mode. Treat yourself to a professional massage, pick up a massage gun, or ask your partner or a loved one for a quick shoulder rub.

**11. Use social media Mindfully**

Social media and other virtual tools allow you to connect with friends and family even when you’re apart. But they can also have unintended consequences if and when using them becomes excessive or too consuming. How can you make sure you’re using them wisely? The more personal your social media interactions, the better, experts say (think direct-messaging people rather than mindless scrolling). Use it intentionally. Be selective about who you follow and what tools you’re using. And take time to disconnect. If you’re feeling isolated, make a point to call a friend or family member once in a while, rather than shooting out another text or Facebook comment.

**12. Practice a Positive Affirmation**

Spending some quiet time with yourself might be all you need. It’s good to teach yourself meditation as a positive affirmation: Pat your heart and say, “It’s okay. I am enough. I have enough. ”This is a nice mantra to use when you notice you’re not feeling okay,” Experts says.

**13. Showcase your self love by pampering yourself**

Taking care of your body in a way that feels like a luxurious break can boost feelings of well-being, Are your nails in need of a little TLC?

Give Yourself a DIY Facial Why limit your home spa experience to a DIY mani-pedi when you might have all the ingredients for a facial in your pantry? Face masks can be really beneficial for your skin because they’re occlusive, meaning they seal in their ingredients against your skin until you wash off the mask. Check out some DIY recipes like the oatmeal and turmeric face masks.

Take a bath, Why is a warm bath so incredibly relaxing? Research suggest one reason may be that it reduces inflammation. According to a study in the December 2018 issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology, just one hot bath can calm your stress response. Another reason is that you're simply allowing yourself to take a break. ""You're taking time away from your to-do list and things you think you 'should' be doing,” “When that happens, you automatically feel like you're dropping into self-care mode.""

**14. Figure Out What Works Best for You When It Comes to Hacking Stress**

Everyone deals with stress in different ways, and the stress-buster that works for you may not work for your best friend. Take a Health’s stress personality test, developed by mental health experts, this can help you better understand your stress personality and some of the best ways to cope with the challenges you face.",False,False,selfhelp,172414,Top,2021,11,Low,2,61,10277,positive,positive,False,False,1,1,0

I need a safe space to tell this,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Warning, it's a long post...
Hi, I am 36 years old and I dont know exactly what I am going thru right now but I can say it's depression. I am facing with problems that i feel never ending and everyday I am trying to deal with them in the best possible way I can think of.

Well let me just give u a glimpse of me, as I said I am 36 years old, live alone, never married, never had kids, single, orphan, no siblings, no family whatsoever, haven't found any job and extremely broke.

I used to stay outside my country for 7 years and last year I decided to moved back to my country tho I know that I dont have a house nor family/parents. 

Even before I moved, I tried to find a job and I never have the luck to be recruited. Lack of work experience, age, physical appearance or education background are always the reason why I dont get hired. I even try to apply as a maid and still I couldn't get any of the job.

So i try my luck by selling crochet items that I make and it didnt really move, sometimes I dont even sell anything, sometimes only 1 items per month.

First few months I paid my bills and rent with the savings i had but it ran out and for the last couple months I sold anything that I had, asking for loan from my friends to buy foods and honestly that's the worst feelings I could have, to beg to people is something i hate but i dont have choice.

Some help but some just talk shit about me behind my back that they thought i didnt know but i knew. They said I am the one whose lazy and dont wanna try and always begging or borrowing money or always asking for help. while they dont even know that it's always a battle in my head everytime i want to ask something to someone, even to my best friend. I will always think about it thousand of times before i ask for help.

I feel like ever since i came back to my country the depression i have is getting worst rather than when i was abroad. I always feel lonely and suicidal thoughts always comes to me oftentimes. 

A small thing can trigger everything and I will start to deteriorating and then depressed.

A few days ago I went to job interview and I was so excited with the job because i felt it was so me. But unfortunately I didnt get the job because of my physical appearance and also my age. At first I felt like crying but I couldn't cry, till the next day when I was chatting with my friend and told him how useless i feel. I even called myself a stupid old lump that is so useless and always burdening people. And God bless his heart, he tried his best to help me and support me and cheer me up. 

I decided to went out for a fresh air and i was okay for a while but when I went back to my rent, I got the confusing feeling again. Like I know i feel sad and disappointed and disgrace and angry but i laughed and then cry and laughed again. 

For couple of days now, I have been having sleep disturbance which I couldn't sleep and everytime i try to sleep I would be awake in a very disturbing way that felt like my heart is about to jump out of my chest and felt like dying. 

Right now as I am writing, I feel numb but confuse and sad and angry and feel stupid and just wanna close off myself from everything and everyone and honestly I feel like I just wanna sleep and never wake up.


Dont tell me to go to the psychiatrist coz i cant afford it, and no i dont have any free health insurance or whatsoever its called. And i cant tell my friends coz they've heard me sharing about this few times back and i have a feeling that they had enough with me. So honestly i dont know what i am doing here in reddit but i guess i just need a safe space to talk this all out.

Might not be PTSD,0,False,False,True,False,15,False,"PTSD is not severe trauma. It has set criteria and there is far too much misinformation.   I think it’s becoming watered down and everyone is claiming PTSD these days.  People brush me off when I share that I have PTSD because they hear it so often. 

This part of the criteria is often overlooked; 

Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:
-Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
-Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
-Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental.

I have been to interviews but I get rejected every time because my anxiety gets really bad during the interview no matter how much I prepare. 

I never worked on building my resumé/career because of executive dysfunction from the depression, and I did the part time jobs to ""buy time"" so that I can get better but I didn't, and now I feel that I've ended my career before it started because I don't really have anything valuable for my resumé.

I have become more introverted and usually socialise with just 1 or 2 good close friends.

My impression is that women only value men who are in a social circle.

How to deal with a struggling family member,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I come to this group with a desperate call for help for a family member.

My sister has struggled for a few years with herself. After COVID, she lost her job that she really loved due to the business closing during the pandemic. She has struggled to regain her footing since and I have lost any idea of what to do.

She has a job but calls out frequently, struggles for money, doesn't drive, and her relationship with our parents is difficult. Any bit of pushing from my parents or me results in a narcissistic rant of ""Nobody loves me,"" or ""Nobody cares about me,"" etc.

I took her to lunch before the New Year, and I had some real optimism about her attitude. Nothing has changed and everyone is at a loss at what to do. I have offered to pay and drive her to therapy, she did one virtual session and called it quits. She doesn't exercise, eat well, or do anything to help herself, and any attempt we make to push her to do any of these things results in pushback or just a dismissive attitude.

I really don't know what to do and I was hoping there would be some suggestions on how others navigated this. I want my Sister to get better but I'm truly at a loss of how to deal with it or help her move forward because she is in her 30s and without being too blunt, we have lives and jobs and cannot manage to hold her hand through every single daily task.

I want to start by saying that I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ASD and ADHD which may help explain some of this.

A while ago, Me (Olivia) and my best friend Amelia (fake names for privacy reasons) found out we had relapsed on the same day because I told her I was 69 days clean then she checked and she was too, so decided that we couldn’t break the streak. We are now over 500 days clean. Amelia and I both think about relapsing a lot but we know if one of us does the other will too (I know that’s not healthy but it was accidental and has genuinely helped us stay clean.) But i’m in a really bad place mentally right now and cannot stop think about relapsing.

Please can someone help me figure out what I should do if I relapsed because i’m stuck in a really awkward situation and have none else to talk to about this.

If it does come to it i have 2 options:
Tell her and have her also relapse and probably not talk to me for ages or, don’t but, she will find out eventually and it will probably hurt more.

I just don’t want to be responsible for her relapsing and hurting herself because we’re both doing so well with it and i know she’s also having a hard time recently.

I can’t live without him. 

I think about my parents who are in their 50s and higher risk for cancer due to their age, and how I’m only 19 and don’t feel like I could live without them yet. How I want them to see my kids grow up and something terrible could take that away at any point. 

I think about my grandparents who are 75 and remarkably healthy for their age but how high the chances of them getting something in the next years is. And how they’ve been around me for so many years I can’t imagine losing them yet.

And because of this I don't have any other option but get to know random people. My friends got girls in school, and in their classes so they talk to them. I don't wanna make excuses but maybe it's sounds like it (or maybe I'm actually making excuses LOL) but they can meet girls easily while I don't even see them cuz there aren't any in my school. Earlier in life I talked to girls and hang out with them and it wasn't a problem. But since I got in this school I feel like everything started getting a bit worse.

Kinda having a breakdown rn,1,True,False,True,False,0,False,"I slept through school today. Surprise, surprise. This happens about once a week. I just can't keep going on 6 hours every night which is what happens because I have to psych myself up to do schoolwork, so I do it late.

Then I had winter guard practice and I was struggling to remember the new drill and work (partially because I've had to miss practice and take it slow because I'm pretty sure I concussed myself, but my parents wouldn't get me to a doctor to confirm). But also just because I can't remember shit right now. (Not like full amnesia from the concussion, just really bad short-term memory)

And my parents gave me money to buy show shirts for my competitions. $100. And I lost it. I forgot to grab it when I got in the car. So we had to drive back. Then I grabbed it.

We need to stop looking to others to validate our progress,70,False,False,True,False,5,False,"It's not easy to make progress in life, so when it happens, it feels like we should be rewarded for it. Attention. Praise. Money. Validation. All external things that we desire. However, I'm starting to realise that these chasing these things leaves us in an unpredictable state. Why? Because they are not in our control.

We can't control how somehow reacts to our progress. When I first started losing weight. Some people were extremely happy for me. Whenever these compliments came in, I would get an insane high that would last for days. However, whenever someone made fun of my weight again, I'd sink into depression for a similar amount of time. I was so sick of the rollercoaster of emotions, and now I realize why. I was completely reliant on receiving validation from others, and so when that well dried up, all I had left was a void.

My progress felt invisible because I wasn't acknowledging it myself. I was too busy focusing on getting others to like me, that I forgot that I needed to like myself. Something that helped me out of this funk was engaging more in positive self-talk. Once I began to start my day with morning affirmations, a sense of calm took hold of me. 

I am capable. I am loved. I am enough. Over time, the intense highs and lows faded away, all that was left was a mellow sense of satisfaction. All because I got validation from the person who truly mattered. Myself.

Unemployment or a Job We Hate Can Foster Depression. Here's a Practical Guide to Help You Change That,0,False,False,True,False,1,False,"First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of unemployment and going through the daily, anxious ordeal that is job searching and the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

This works for anyone wanting to get a promotion, change careers entirely, or are job searching in general.

I feel a large portion of us with depression/anxiety could be helped significantly by finding a less stressful job we like or a career that's a little more fufilling. 

Job searching and interviewing alone can make one's skin crawl. 

I. Hated. It! 

During that year-long period of unemployment, I vowed that if I ever landed a decent role (hell, *any r*ole!) I would share with others how I did it.

Well, I am happily here to say that I did land a relatively stress-free job finally, and my depression/anxiety, while still ""there"" to some extent, has gotten *signifcantly* better.

But the process was long, arduous and soul crushing. 

You likely have experienced or are currently experiencing this drill:

Wake up. Scour job boards and apply into an abyss of countless other applicants. Read rejection emails. Tweak resume for new jobs. Go to bed feeling hopeless.

Rinse and repeat.

Each day seemed worse than the one before, job coaches costed money I didnt have, prepping for and participating in interviews made my *heart race like it never had befor*e, and I had no idea if my method was even the best way to go about getting a role.

Fast forward one year and an infinite number of mistakes and edits later, and got that aforementioned job using some nifty methods and formats! 

Below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches, and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out *how*), complete with notes on how you can do it, too. (They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after these edits and methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

So, if we must work and search for work in this life, here is how I got recruiters attention with a solid resume/cover letter, as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that containt practical tips and tricks for how to get a role or even switch careers:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those who may be actively or passively looking for a job or promotion.

It's something I wish I had a year ago.

I probably wouldnt have had to go to the mental hospital *three* times during that year if I had this.

Which ironically cost a small fortune because I had basic marketplace health insurance.

As mentioned eaerlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it. After months of trying to just get an interview, this style got us interviews in no time.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---> number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anywways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.                                                   
This is *KEY!*                                                                                                                                                       
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---> ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----> $23K+; $5 million ---> $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10.  I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- just wanted to say that I love (company name). Your job as a (role) is kind of what I have been wanting to do for some time. How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site hunter.io to find anyones work email (i.e. recruiters) to send cold emails to (email templates in the link), or you can get even slicker and use a free scraping software like Phantom Buster to ""scrape"" (i.e. extract) emails from LinkedIn profiles, if they arent publicly listed. Totally legal, btw and a great resource. [https://phantombuster.com/](https://phantombuster.com/)

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of chronic depression and at times, absolutely debiltating anxiety. The job search made me super depressed that year, and more anxious than I ever was in my life.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

Because again, if I have to work to survive, I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

All I ask is if it helps you:

1. share it with someone you know looking for work
2. send me a DM or comment and let me know if it helped. I selfishly could use a little ""I did something good"" mood boost right now lol

Also very open for suggestions in the comments to methods that worked for you as well.

\-----------------------

P.S. For those who are interested, I helped several of my friends land a relatively stress free, remote job that they say also pays decent.

They work in software renewals / Customer Success (*not C*ustomer Support).

**The Difference?**

Customer *Success* you call already happy customers, usually not angry and you just check to see if they are happy, a little upselling sometimes, but it's really not bad. My friends who have this job would definitely never refer to themselves as salesmen, and all find it to be relatively low-stress, all things considered.

In Customer *Support,* customers are calling *you* and complaining about everything that is wrong and wanting refunds/fixes/etc. They seem similar because of the title, but they are way different.

Basically just make sure clients are happy (they almost always are), calls are easy and training easier.

Typically $70-85k year depending on the SaaS company.

They say it's the best pay for lowest effort job out there, and great starter to get in at a company, if that's what you are looking for.

Also many of those roles are remote now and they said basically you just need to hit reasonable call numbers or client ""connects."" They also mentioned that's why you can make your own schedule outside of mandatory meetings, just as long as you meet KPIs.

This is also not a call center job. There are calls, of course, but not nearly as many and you get a higher base pay with only some element of commissions (instead of heavy-loaded or full commission). Usually it's and 80/20 or 70/30 split, but again, its not that hard to meet quota, they say.

No degree needed usually.

A little bit of sales background helps to get in with companies, but the job doesn’t have *that* much sales orientation. (The resumes in the link provided will show you how to craft a sales related resume with lots of numbers).

Anyways, I thought I would throw that in at the end.

[Throwaway Account] Something strange has been happening to me lately.,4,True,False,True,False,20,False,"I know I probably shouldn't look too much into it, after all it could just be my mind playing tricks on me, but that's what I'm scared about. School started for me a week ago. My daddy drove me to school the first week. I've been having trouble catching the bus in the mornings-I have to wake up at four just to be able to catch it. (Which sucks.) 

I set my alarm for four aclock every night. It rings, I set it to snooze, and then I tell it to wake me up a little while later. I use this-http://www.online-stopwatch.com/online-alarm-clock/- just in case you were wondering.

But here's the thing. I set it for maybe thirty or fourty minutes later, and it never rings. My dad wakes me up a little while later and I ended up missing school today. For the past few days, the volume was completely down. And the alarm was never set. The volume might be computer problems-but the alarm? I don't know how to explain that. I ALWAYS have my volume at the highest possible level. Who the fuck is turning it down????

I came home high the other day. We have three .T.V.'s-the one in the living room is broke, so I use the one outside. It was the news. As soon as I got outside, I didn't hear the .T.V. on anymore. We always leave it on. I tell my dad not to, but he does anyways. I go back inside-I hear the .T.V. I go out? It's off. I did this a couple times. If I wanted to watch .T.V., I had to do it inside. I was too freaked out anyways. I got my backpack and went down to my friend's house, and stayed there until five minutes before my dad got home. I was so terrified that when I heard my bedroom door open finally, I pissed myself. I was so embarrassed I actually started crying.

 I'm 13-I'm not a little baby. I don't wet my bed or suck my thumb when I sleep. What the fuck is going on? I don't believe in ghosts, or the paranormal so it can't be that. I already have enough to deal with. My family is extremely healthy, I am too. The last time my dad and his girlfriend got sick, I was totally fine and we all sleep in the same bed when they're not doing it. What's wrong with me?

Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. And sorry if it doesn't make sense-I'm freaking out just thinking about it. Thanks so much for reading, and if you do, helping. I asked my dad for a therapist, btw. He said he'd get to it but he never did. (Just like when I saw a credit card my mom had in my name, he never checked my credit. This was like a year ago.)

DAE anxiety manifest as 90% time feeling completely indifferent and just tired but then occasionally having anxiety and/or panic attacks usually with no specific trigger?,1,True,False,True,False,0,False,"So I’m not officially diagnosed with anxiety. However I have recently been experiencing, for lack of a better word, episodes of anxiety/panic usually with no apparent trigger. However they are not happening often and I do not have recurring anxious thoughts. However I am taking Adderall XR for my ADHD which I believe is know to ease symptoms of anxiety. 

Typically my mood is very indifferent, I am neither in a good mood or a bad mood I just kinda am. I have historically had intense feelings of anxiety when it came to certain situations, such as when travel doesn’t go very smoothly or there’s an unexpected change of plans, I get very anxious when it comes to asking teachers/parents for help particularly in regards to academics, and due to what may or may not be past trauma I cannot even check my grades or look at feedback on assignments without freaking out. I got better when it came to talking to professors about getting a bit of help or an extension for assignments but overall it still makes me anxious to the point my hands are shaking and my chest feels tight until the conversation is over. But if such situations are avoided I’m fine. But these days when I do get anxious it can become very bad very quickly. I’ll suddenly have this feeling of dread and doom, my chest feels heavy and it’s harder to breath, I start shaking and I can feel the panic rising within me.

Usually there is no specific reason, I just for some reason feel that way, occasionally I’ll have some specific thought, fear or stressor, for example when I first started noticing my anxiety/panic attacks while on vacation for winter break I was convinced, for three straight evenings, that I was gonna get a call from my landlord to tell me the apartment burnt down and would continuously check my phone to see if I missed a call or email. This morning I had a panic attack cause I forgot to submit and important document regarding my lease and was half convinced I’d be evicted in two months and then spent 6 hours soothing it until finally I got word that the issue was resolved and was able to calm down mostly. I still am slightly shaky 2 hours later but am mostly fine. 

Other times I have no specific thing I am worrying about or that causes the attacks. Anxiety does run in my family and my siblings and mom all developed around the same time I am (roughly 19-20y/o)

I am seeing a university counselor and they cannot give me a formal diagnosing but have said that I probably do have anxiety and are working with me to develop coping strategies and to work through any issues related to it and told me to look into as needed medication which I have an appointment with the campus doctor who also now prescribes my Adderall (I’ve been taking Adderall XR since I was about 8-9 y/o) to determine if and/or what medication i could take for it.

"I'm struggling to deal with a traumatic event, when I'm being told I should be feeling proud.",1,True,False,True,False,1,False,"Context: I'm a merchant seafarer, and late last year I was on a ship coming back from the Falkland Islands to the UK. I have long had anxiety issues, but they're manageable. Work had been very stressful, and deep sea engineering is always a bit tough, especially away from a wife and two young girls.

We encountered a migrant boat in between Morocco and the Canary Islands, about 1000 one morning last November. It was low in the water, and more than full with people. Mostly men, but at least a dozen women (we found later three were pregnant), two children, and one baby. We contacted the Spanish coast guard, who told us to shelter them and stand by, as they were sending help. This was around 1100, and they said they'd be four hours. We were 115 miles from Gran Canaria, deep sea. A blazing hot day, calm seas; we put the boat in our lee, and dropped them water and food.

At 1430, the boat began to sink.

I was in the engine room, reinstating a bilge pump that I'd just repaired. The 2nd engineer came and grabbed me, and told me to stand by in the control room, as the rescue was on. I phoned the bridge, and was told to get a radio on, and stand by.

This, for me, was the worst part, and has lead to so much guilt and mental anguish. I had to listen to my friends risking their lives to rescue fifty seven people, unable to leave my post, but hearing every second of it on the radio.

I heard the Captain shout 'no, no, NO!' as three people entered the water against the ship side. 

I heard my best friend say 'there's nothing we can do for her, she's drowned'

And I felt like I was doing nothing. I was doing my job, but I felt so godamn helpless.

We rescued 57 people, and took them all to safety. One didn't make it, a woman who was trampled to death in a shitty little boat, drowned in petrol, piss, and seawater. We had to cut the boat loose with her in it. Yellow trousers, white top. I can't let it go.

It's been a couple on months now. I'm home, away from work, away from the ship and the sea. I'm in the arms of my family. But I just can't forget it.

Why do I (15F) feel a sense of impending doom that I cannot shake? What should I do?,0,False,False,True,False,13,False,"
I (15F) am miserable. I have been for maybe 3 years now, my depression only getting worse as time moves on. 
I have not been diagnosed with anything other than ADD when I was very, very young, but I have leading suspicions for some sort of clinical depression, anxiety, or some sort of BPD. 

I live with my mom, my moms boyfriend, my grandma, and my baby brother. My brother is a bit of a meanie, but means well. Even so, I often project anger and resentment against him, and my mom. They annoy me beyond my own comprehension and I hate that I am never not irritated with my living situation. My mom is always throwing a lecture at me that I never seem to remember any part of and cannot make myself pay any attention to. She is always nagging about something and I hoped to never end up as miserable as her, but I fear I'm actually far more. They're good to me and love me, but I cannot take it. I want to move out as soon as I can, but I'm even scared to do that.

I've been in a pretty healthy relationship with a boy (15M), but it's been pretty distant, we don't have much in common, and I don't think I was ever mentally prepared to be with someone, since I can barely take my normal situation just alone. I've considered breaking up with him every other day because I am getting quite little out of this relationship, and he probably deserves better.

I am failing at least 2 classes at all times. I used to blame teachers (and I was right), bit now I blame myself. I cannot make myself do any homework when I get home. I feel like doing nothing. My interests no longer entertain me. My hobbies are sat aside all day for me to rot in my bed while doomscrolling Instagram or Tiktok or Reddit.

I have no actual coping mechanisms that help me long term. I cry and/or masturbate nightly, just to shake off overwhelm or sadness and either way, I go to sleep feeling guilty about something I cannot put my finger on. I used to often break down at school or in public. I still do, but I find a corner or a bathroom to do this in. 

I used to find a big joy in mornings of dressing up really colorfully and cute everyday, but as I get more and more tired, a pair of jeans or slacks and a hoodie is the go to. I barely even brush my hair anymore. It's been stuck in a puffy pony for about a week, with the occasional removing the band and putting it back in to ""refresh"" my hair. I hate my looks and my body and I go back and forth between denial and acceptance of it. I weigh 240 pounds and I am 5'10. I have no patience or time for eating well or exercising. 

I miss and envy who I was before 2020. I was a gifted academic student and never had any mental, emotional, or physical issues. I hadn't much thunk about life afterwards. I'm weighed down by literally everything now and I feel like I'm in the worst state to take on this challenge. I'm black, I'm queer, I'm a woman I'm not very attractive, I talk a lot, I grew up sheltered and have trouble making good friends, I have no balls and no grip on anything. I am an atheist, by logic not by choice, and I used to be a Christian. Not bring a Christian I think ruined my joy? Part of why I no longer believe is because when my doom and depression started, I asked God to give me strength and I got nothing. I was maybe 8 at the time. I waited and waited and I still haven't got that strength. It just seems as if he didn't hear me.

With the war that I see everyday in Palestine and the Congo, with my American government getting worse, with my extreme Agraphobia, with knowing that the only way I'll ever be able to get enough money to sustain myself is to get at least a Bachelors innan ""actual"" degree that I probably won't like, with knowing that I still have at least 6 years of school ahead of me, with knowing that the friends I have now are probably not going to last, with Inflation being so bad I may have to work two jobs in the future, with knowing that I have no actual purpose and everything that makes me happy is material or superficial or absurd, I feel a resentment  and hatred towards waking up everyday and simply just living. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I definitely do not wanna be here and I have considered it. I do not believe in a god, so I don't fear any concerns or consequences to doing so. Life is very meaningless to me at this point and I want my old life back. I'd kill for it to be 2018 again.

me and my grandma were really close ever since i was born -which was on her birthday- and she was always the one i could rely on. she suffered from cancer for the past two years, and her condition only got worse since last august. i tried to visit her as much as i could, but as selfish i was, as worse her health became, i was afraid to meet her and face the truth that her health was going downhill. she was hospitalised, but my parents didn’t really let me visit her there, since she got so sick, they didn’t know how i would react. nevertheless, as soon as i heard that she didn’t have a month left to live, i visited her asap. when i saw her there, she wasn’t the woman, who i knew since i was born.. a week after that, she sadly passed away.

i just have no idea how i’m supposed to deal with this whole situation right now and i’m kind of lost. i feel helpless, i haven’t slept normally since she passed, and the worst thing is, that i have the same thumb as she had, so i’m constantly reminded when i look at my hands.

i have never lost anyone this close in my life. i am also suffering from bpd and depression, so i’m also on meds and stuff, so this isn’t something i feel like i’m strong enough for. i feel like my mental health decreased a lot, and i can’t feel happy without the constant guilt of “i’m supposed to be crying home, alone right now”. some family problem has also happened, which led me to having panic attacks, that i didn’t have until now…

Worried about my Wife's Mental Wellbeing and 20 Month old Son,10,True,False,True,False,6,False,"I'm in need of some guidance, and I'd appreciate any input you guys have. Long story short, I'm concerned about my wife's mental wellbeing, and by default, the well being of our 20 month old son.

I am a general contractor, and my wife is a nurse practitioner. We both decided it would be best for our family for her to stay at home with our son so that we wouldn't have to send him to day care. We really missed out on his first year of life, and we wanted a lifestyle that would allow her to be a stay at home mom. We lived in an expensive area of the country, and decided that moving to a less expensive area closer to family, would be better in the long run.

We both left our jobs and moved in September of last year. Initially, she was ecstatic to be home with our son, and I was more than happy to work long hours,  60+ per week, starting my own business so that we could make this work.

Our son has never been a good sleeper, and we have tried literally every sleep program, specialist, training, etc., but he still rarely sleeps through the night, which he should be doing from basically 8pm to 7am, and he has terrible naps, which should be about 2 hours from around 12-2PM

His crying and need for attention has really, really gotten to her in the past month. I've tried to stay home as much as possible and work from home, but my job requires me to be in the field most days. This has obviously put more strain on here, and she is with our son from 7am to 8pm, with a small break during his nap. He is such a happy and fun little boy, and a joy to be around when he is awake. and my wife is such a caring and concerned person, and a loving mother. She wants to help him or obsess over him when he is crying, and I think it is to the point now of being unhealthy.

Last night, he woke up around 11pm, and continued to cry for the next hour. We have been trying to sleep train him for the last 16 months, sometimes successfully, sometime not - and generally we will check on him once after he starts crying to make sure he hasn't peed or pooped his diaper and that he comfy. We did this, but he kept crying. After about an hour, my wife sat up in bed and put her hands in her head and commented that ""I can't take this any more, I'm going to either harm myself or harm him.""

She has NEVER said anything like this before, and it really freaked me out. She is a wonderful healthcare provider, and she is well respected and loved by all her previous patients and co-workers. It just really struck home with me because for her to say something like that is not even remotely normal, and she would never ""joke"" or be dramatic about something as serious as that, especially given her profession. I immediately got up and went in his room and got him so that he would stop crying, and proceeded to stay with him for the next few hours so he would sleep.

This morning, she seemed to be in a better mental state and acted as if nothing happened, but I am very concerned that this will happen again soon, or when I am not at home while he naps. I'm not sure what to do next, if I should seek help from someone, etc. I don't want to alienate her or embarrass  her, but obviously my son's well being and her well being are paramount here.

How can I learn to love my chest?,1,False,False,True,False,9,False,"Sorry if this seems like a petty issue compared to some of the others on this subreddit, and if this isn't the best place, then please feel free to redirect me to a better location to make this post.
Basically, I have some pretty steep self-confidence issues, and most of them are linked to my small physique. I'm very skinny (which I don't hate that particular aspect), and don't have a lot of cleavage and a small ass. I suppose my ass doesn't bother me as much, as it's behind me and I'll never see someone judging it right in front of my face. However, I'm about a 26E, which if you don't know is a ""sister-size"" of a 36A, so my breasts are pretty small. I have a wonderful boyfriend who over the almost 2 year span that we've been together has really helped me love them more than I did before, but I'm still very sensitive about them. It seems like everywhere I look, someone is making fun of a flat-chested girl, and praising larger boobs and saying how perfect they are. I feel as though it wouldn't get to me as much if larger boobs also got made fun of every now and again, but that honestly never seems to happen. Unfortunately, I know the world will never be a place where no one ever gets made fun of and everyone is loved equally, so I suppose I have to learn how to accept this seemingly major character flaw I possess.

"Why do men on Reddit look stupid when they feel bad about their small dicks, when the media, social discourse, and real-life experiences reinforce these men's negative thoughts? 99 percent of the commenters on this site invalidate the feelings of these men.",0,False,False,True,False,1,True,"A million people in the mainstream media and pop culture have honestly said that size matters and that small dicks are bad, and men with small penises are constantly humiliated. This is also the case on social media, just watch any video where real girls are asked about it, most of them say that size matters, small is not satisfactory, under 6 inches is ridiculous and inappropriate, 6 inches for some girls it's already acceptable, but the really good shit starts at 7 inches. Only a few sex therapists say in the media that men with small dicks are not trash, but they are obviously saying what their potential patients want to hear because they make a living from it, but in their private lives they would never choose a small partner either.

And most importantly, real experiences also support this assumption, the guy with a small tail who has already been with a few women knows exactly that, except for a few special girls (about 1%), women do not like small dicks, they do not enjoy it sex, and if by chance they started dating such a man, they gradually reduce the relationship, of course, most of the time they would not openly say what the problem is for the world, and the reasons for this are the fear of men's reaction and the social hypocrisy instilled in them regarding the topic.

&#x200B;

So I don't understand at all what is the point of society-wide lying, when you can find out the truth from many places. The problem with the honest sources, however, is that in addition to being honest, they mock and humiliate guys with small penises. I think the only normal solution to the situation would be for people to learn to talk HONESTLY and HUMANELY about this topic. The reality of the problem should not be denied, and it should be recognized that men with small penises are sexually impaired, sexually disabled. At the same time, they should not be ridiculed, society could assure them of its support and help these individuals live the best life they can, even if that does not include a sexually satisfied partner and a happy relationship. This would reduce the frustration of these men and many of them would be able to accept their fate.",False,False,mentalillness,149344,Controversial,2023,7,Very low,0,257,2166,negative,positive,False,False,0,0,0

2yrs ago almost died. Now wife has ptsd.,43,False,False,True,False,64,False,"So two years ago I got really sick and went to the hospital.  Turns out of got a blood infection. Sepsis and endocridist which killed my heart valve.  For 3 week my wife visited me in the hospital (I was told) and I was pretty much dying, I remember nothing really until they woke me up. I think they woke me up to just see if I’d wake up.  Finally the figured out my issue and replaced my heart valve. 2 more weeks I got to go home, 5 weeks total in ER,ICU etc  That was nearly 2 years ago.  Today. I’m strong healthy and mentally pretty strong.  I go to the gym have lots of friends and remain pretty happy. 

But my wife suffers from ptsd.  Our shared pcp has her in on antidepressants and told me once “.. I’m not sure I can fix her with meds”. 

I have been living in a “dead bed” situation.  She understands my needs I try not to push to hard (no pun) but her ptsd is really getting me down. I feel like she is trying to distance me because she almost lost me.  But it’s really hurtful to sort of be ignored.  She says it “hurts”.  I’m not ready. It feels a bit like a new relationship where a gal might not to get “involved” as your not really what she wants.  Only it’s my wife. Mother of my 3 kids. We built so much. Traveled and did so much. Now it’s (the relationship) is dying. 

And she has a bad habit of always trying to destroy any enjoyment I take in life. Movies with the guys, why don’t you take the kids.  I got a NICE car — why did you buy that used junk. 

We have 3 kids. I got a great union job. We got cash, no debt at all, rental income Like everything on paper looks amazingly good. We are really really lucky.  But it’s not.  I know it’s not a logical problem. I honestly feel me getting past open heart surgery is easier than living with the toll it took on her mind. 

She over and over refuses to get see any psychologist or marriage consuling. She keeps tells to get a GF “.. for those needs” which is actually really hurtful to hear.  I love my family and what we built and I tell her this.

I have actually had a psychiatric eval and guys said in 5 min. “hey you seem strong great normal “ I dint think you need meds. “. I don’t feel I do either. And I saw a physiologist on my own to learn how to help her. Who encouraged me to set boundaries etc.  I think I’ll go she that psychologist again soon. I haven’t been since early summer. 

 I never thought I’d be “here” in my life.  There was a post a few days ago that shed light on a wife wishing her husband didn’t have to deal with her ptsd.

"So, I finally went to an Abuse Shelter...",195,False,False,True,False,26,False,"I got in another argument with my husband yesterday, and it was the last straw. I grabbed my purse, phone, and charger, and walked out the door and walked my ass all the way to the hospital. I'm on medicaid, and was bawling the whole time, trying to hold it together at the check-in desk.

When the Drs came in to see me, they asked why I was here today (as they do). I said "" well, you know how when you go to a Dr., and they ask you ""do you feel safe at home?""? Well... I don't feel safe, and my husband has become abusive over the last year... And I didn't know where else to go."" I was afraid that they would take me in, involuntarily, and force me to go to the psych ward because I was feeling immensely suicidal, but I told them it's ***strictly*** because of the living situation I was in. If I could just get out, then I wouldn't feel so bad... 

One Vietnamese woman, who examined my vitals, spoke from her heart to me, and said that she too was in an abusive relationship, and she got out. ""Don't let anyone make you feel small."" She said. ""You deserve to be happy.""

A Social Worker talked to me for an hour, and she was extremely kind towards me... She was so positive, and uplifting, and kept telling me how amazed she was at my resilience. I told her, statistically speaking, I shouldn't be here. Every year in my life, I've had at least, one traumatic episode. I wrote it all out on a timeline, for my therapy... Seeing it on paper made me really realize how severe my depression really was... But she kept telling me that she believed in me, that Im going places, and there's not a doubt in her mind that I will achieve great things in my lifetime. I could tell she doesn't just say this to everyone, because she mentioned how the majority of the patients she sees, have not yet come to this level of clarity. She said she wished we could spend more time talking, and we probably talked for over an hour, but I genuinely felt like she truly Saw Me that day...

So now I'm in a shelter. Hidden away, like an oasis. No yelling, no screaming, no fighting... Just nature surrounding us. Birds, owls, raccoons, deer, they're all here... And the shelter is providing everything for me. New clothes, toiletries, a nice bed with a few blankets... Why did I not call sooner? 

Today Im going back to my house to collect some of my essential belongings, with an escort. I'm stressed about having to go back, but Im also relieved I have somewhere to seclude now...

I’ve been dating this guy for two months. He is a veteran. He treated me like a Queen for two months. It was genuine, he was a gentleman with very traditional values. I don’t trust words or actions, I trust my intuition. As an empath, I felt his love.  Last week, he confessed that he had a gut feeling that he had met his future wife the moment he met me. I was a little sleep deprived that day, so he told me to reflect on it once I’ve had some sleep and get back to him in a day or two (about whether or not I want to give this relationship a proper go). I got back to him two days later and said I was open to giving it a go and seeing where life takes us. He got so happy, called me, and wanted to see me then and there. I said I couldn’t cos I had other plans. He then made all these bookings for the week ahead (movies, a play etc). I then got Covid and couldn’t see him for a week, all our plans got cancelled. I finally recovered and he took me out to dinner. After dinner, he sat me down and said that he hadn’t slept for three nights. He said he felt anxiety about us, that maybe his body was telling him something. He said he didn’t feel good enough for me/was worried about hurting me (I’ve already been through enough as I have lost both parents to cancer). He said he was confused about how he felt about me, that it wasn’t black or white but grey. He said he wanted to end things. He said “it’s not anxiety or depression or anything”…and somewhere in passing he mentioned “not having the will to live”. He said he didn’t have PTSD from the army but struggled with his emotions after it and got help. He said he couldn’t feel emotions properly after the army but got help for it. I said to him “is this because you don’t love me? Just say it” and he said “I can’t sat I don’t love you, I’d be lying”. I begged him to tell me he didn’t love me, but he couldn’t say it. He walked away and then came back and held me and kissed my forehead and said he was going to pray for me. He held me for like 15 mins and wouldn’t leave until I went inside. I was so shocked. How can someone go from “I see you as my future wife” to “I need to leave you and I’m confused”

Moving out anxiety,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"Hello I am a 23F and I just moved out of my parents house and into an apartment with my boyfriend of 3 years (26M). He has lived on his own since 18. I moved in yesterday and have cried 2 times the night before, 4 times the day of, and 3 times today. 
I didn’t move far only about 20 min but I feel so anxious all the time. There are good parts but I miss my parents and my animals and the comfort of home. I wish I wasn’t an adult and didn’t have to leave home eventually. I keep feeling like I’m not ready but if not know then when? Does this anxiety and such mean I don’t love my boyfriend? 
I grew up having horrible seperation anxiety from my mom and twin sister but this feels a bit like that but also like more. I sit here and think “this is my life, I’m away from my parents and will never truly be in their care again” they are my safe space. I feel I’m going to miss out on a bunch and that I won’t have them here when I need them. I have a fear of getting sick and they say I can always come home when I’m sick but it’s different. 
This place doesn’t feel like home and I know it may be because of boxes but I also just miss my pets so much. 
I was here alone today so I visited home and felt a lot better but my depression is kicking in. 
I just can’t believe this is it. I’m out of my parents house and I just want to go back. But if I go back then it will really hurt my relationship and possibly set me backwards in life. Every box I unpack gives me anxiety and I keep thinking of the worst such as, “how would I pack this all up if my boyfriend and I broke up?” Like I feel like I’m always planning for the worst as a way to protect myself. 
I have no idea what to do. We plan on getting a pet within a month or 2 because I know my big thing is having a pet around but these last 3 days have been so much emotionally and I have to work tomorrow which is just adding anxiety.

How do I cope with ptsd and anxiety from a terrible relationship?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Long story short: I was with a narc. I dumped them a year ago, but they have continued to try and make me upset and it's just been a terrible time trying to recover from what they did. They betrayed me, spread lies about me, tried to steal from me, cheated on me and just in general treated me like absolute shit. All the while they manipulated me into believing they loved me.

I am not actually someone who is generally pessimistic and sad, but this situation has just taken a huge toll on my mental health. They thought they were better than me based on absolutely nothing, constantly gave me backhanded insults and tried to pass themselves off as a great person in front of others. I just can't seem to stop thinking about this and feeling awful about myself. Part of me, I guess, still feels like I deserved it, but that was their goal of course.

I already do positive, useful things that make me feel good about myself and I try to block out as much unnecessary negative stuff I can, but it just haunts me.

since I was 12 i really started to understand the world around me. remembering bad things from my childhood. then getting older and having more trauma come to life. 

Since the time I started to understand life, I’ve also started to realise that I don’t know what I’m thinking anymore. I can think one thing and then think another that juxtaposes each other. 

As of right now at 17, im on my 3rd college course (all of which I have not completed due to mental health). I should be at college right now but I can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to be a failure, I want to have something for myself and I want to do good in life.

But I also don’t care anymore. I don’t think I’ll get far in life anyway. I don’t think i deserve this life. what’s the point in me getting up everyday. 

And this is the problem. im aware of the fact I can think both positively and negatively. but it’s tiring. I can tell myself im worth it, but then do nothing to show im worth it because I then thought that im not worth it. So I just choose to rot away and not live like i should. 

I think it stems down to self sabotage. I don’t know why I seem to get a kick out of being miserable with nothing. I guess im comfortable in this bubble I’ve made for myself. yet I know I should be happy. and I don’t want to feel sad all the time. The negative thoughts always take over.

Anxiety Spiral - Advice Needed! ,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hi all, I'm a 26M guy who has been dealing with panic and anxiety for a large majority of my life. My anxiety and panic were evident early on in elementary school with separation anxiety from my mom and an intense fear of fires, to the point where things like fire alarms would send me into a panic. 

It became more disordered in 8th grade since I started developing GERD and the symptoms included chest pain/tightness, and my health anxiety spiked and stayed elevated. During this episode I started with a psychiatrist and began Prozac, which seemed to work well for me. 

Fast forward to me being 21, I'd been stable on Prozac for multiple years and I brought on a panic attack from smoking too much weed one time. The heightened anxiety state persisted and the derealization and loss of appetite quickly followed. I lived far away from my parents at that time but stayed with my partner for a couple nights and ultimately was forced to move back to my apartment and continue with work. It was a really difficult period of my life but I think the routine of going to work everyday really helped instill some normalcy. 

Fast forward to 5 years later (now). I've been doing so well that over the past few months my psychiatrist and I have tried weaning me off of my Prozac, which was a little rocky but I was noticing some of the pros I was hoping to achieve (feeling more positive emotions, being able to cry, sexual function). This past January I was completely off Prozac. Then I got a cold that turned into an ear infection that muted like 80% of my hearing in my left ear, and my health anxiety spiraled. The antibiotics have treated the ear infection, but even with it gone I'm stuck in this increased anxiety state. The past week I've hardly been able to eat, and I'm experiencing the whole nine yards of ""what if's"" and intrusive thoughts. My parents recently moved near me a few months ago, and with me unable to nourish myself right now I've moved in with them for support. 

The problem I'm facing this time is that while in the past I've had work or a routine to distract myself, this time around I don't have much to do. I'm in school but this semester is extremely lowkey compared to past semesters, so I don't have that routine to depend on. It's been really great being with my parents for that support, but I feel myself developing a dependency and that in itself is stressing me out. A couple days ago I tried going back to my apartment for the night, but spiraled drastically. I find myself fearing being alone, because I don't know how to spend my alone time, which I have a lot of. Mornings have been extremely tough since I've been waking up at 6am and unable to fall back asleep, and instead laying in bed for an hour ruminating on thoughts. 

I've been trying to do some things to help myself. I've been getting back into meditation, I've started back on 20mg Prozac with my psychiatrist's advice, I had a session with my therapist where we started developing family systems with my intrusive thoughts, and I've been reading a book called ""Dare"" by Barry Mcdonagh that I've seen on a few threads. 

I guess my big fear right now is if I'm creating a dependent state I won't be able to escape from. Being with my parents brings me comfort and makes it a little easier to feed myself and take care of myself, but the thought of moving back into my apartment is poking in the back of my brain.

Roommate (18F) called her father when she felt suicidal,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"On Monday night, my roommate who I will refer to as Mango, called her father and told him that she wanted to buy alcohol or overdose on her pills. (Mango shares a room with my other roommate Cat. Cat(19F) is the one who told me(23F) everything that happened btw as I sleep in another room that I share with another roommate.) So Cat told me that she woke up to banging on her door at 3am and when she opened it, it was the police. Mango's father called them. Cat was very traumatized and scared about the whole thing. Mango was sleeping but then the cops woke her up and said they had to take her to a hospital to get checked. 

Cat was crying and calling her parents as she didn't know what was going on and I can imagine she was startled by the whole situation and will probably be traumatized for a while.

Mango has been suffering with alcoholism since the first time I met her which was last year when we moved in the dorms(end of August). we never mentioned anything to her as we didn't know how to approach it or if we were supposed to approach it in the first place. We did tell management but they said that since she's legal(we're in Canada btw), they can't do much. Then she left end of October to go back home and told us that she won't be back until next semester as she was diagnosed with depression and needed some time away from school and be with her family. 

When she came back last month, she looked so much better. She told us that she is on anti-depressants, she has sleeping pills(she used to stay up all night and Cat couldn't sleep because she could hear Mango watching tiktoks loudly, vaping, and she would put random alarms in the middle of the night and very early mornings which cause Cat to feel some sort of resentment towards Mango), and that she has a therapist that she talks to weekly. 

Now unto the problem. Mango came back today and Cat is very stressed about it. She doesn't feel safe or okay with her being back as she doesn't know if what happened on Monday will happen again. Or worse, that one day she wakes up and Mango is dead. I feel like we all have to talk to Mango about what happened but idk what to say and how to say it? And I don't want to say the wrong thing and trigger her or something. 

We also found out that Mango has relapsed into her alcoholism as we found wine boxes(3) and a bottle of chardonnay behind her bed while Cat and I were cleaning her part of the room a little bit. 

Do we bring up the alcohol or is that none of our business? Do we even talk to her about what happened on Monday?

28- orthorexia self diagnosed. i think i have gotten better. i got it when i was 15 and started with cutting soda plus fast food out. no candy bars or junk food aside from maybe nature valley bars.,0,False,False,True,False,0,False," 

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you.

So quickly and anonymously summarize myself, i'm 23 years old and a queer man living the rural, southern united states.

I joked that my secret is I'm a vampire and never go outside, and she said she's the same.  I considered giving her my number or asking her for hers, then got....a very strong nervous feeling about it.  I didn't want to ask her that while she's technically at work.

When I left she seemed to make a point of waving and saying goodbye to me.  This was in a fairly busy coffee shop with maybe 20 people hanging around and people going in and out.

Does that ring any bells?,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Does anyone have any idea of what this behaviour could be the symptom of?

Hi, I'm 22 and my boyfriend is 23. We're together for more than 2 years. My boyfriend has had anger issues prior to our relationship and it shows as him getting extraordinarily furious at (for me) small inconveniences. However the thing is no matter how blown out of proportion his reactions were to me they always made some kind of sense. There was a clear trigger and a big reaction. Yesterday though I experienced something for the first time with him because his reaction makes no sense to me at all. I want to know if anybody has an idea of what this could be, because it is abnormal in his behaviour. (After the story I'm going to share my theory)


He came back from work and we were about to watch a TV show together. He was excited to spend time with me for the whole day. He has a box-diet (meals are brought to your house by a company and you have to heat them up) and I don't. At the shop I picked up some groceries just for myself since he has his own food for the next day. He was interested in one protein shake which I bought for myself as work food. I said he cannot take that but I can give him something similar. He's like 'well I don't want that but we could make a deal. I'll give you my dessert (some kind of yoghurt) and take that protein drink.' 
I said that I'm not sure because I don't even know what the dessert in question was. He said that I enjoyed it in the past and I can take it to work too. I wasn't sure what I'm looking at so I wanted to grab the box to read the label and I assume he wanted to bring the box closer to me at the same moment resulting in: me accidentally knocking out the plastic box with my elbow (I have coordination issues) and the yoghurt spilling on the floor. Just like when you drop it in the shop. 90% of it was still in the box so my reaction was just 'oh-oh'. Because literally nothing else have happened. No stain on the clothes, the floor is just tiles- easy to clean. 

Suddenly he says with the look of disappointment: 'no words....' (this means I'm speechless in a negative way in our language). I try to explain that you can still eat the dessert and he yells 'then FUCKING eat it!'. After some more back and forth interactions i confronted him even though I knew he was still delusional at that point:
-what do you mean by 'fucking eat it', that was an accident and nothing terrible actually happened. What's going on?
-get the fuck away to your hometown if you don't see the issue (something among these lines: I've just came back from a trip to my hometown).

Then he closed himself in 'his' room, watch something on YT while being extremely quiet and fell asleep on the bed with head facing the bed.

And that's it. There is nothing more to this story. My bf got furious at me accidentally knocking over a plastic box.



This felt like him re-enacting a scene from his childhood which was very traumatic. Like a parent yelling at a child for making a mistake.

How to Stop Caring What Others think of you,3,False,False,True,False,0,False," 

In order to stop caring what others think of you, You need to understand the root cause of this behavior and why we do it

According to psychology, Our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us. If we were criticized, neglected, or abused, we are more likely to have low self-esteem and be more sensitive to the judgments of others.

Interestingly, studies show that children as young as two years old are already aware that they’re being evaluated by others, and they will adjust their behavior to seek a positive response.  
This need for social acceptance and fear of rejection is still present in adulthood because social media has become another common approach to seek approval. where many of us consider social media personas as an extension of your self worth, even though your value as a person hasn’t changed.  
So we cant just delete this human nature out of our system so what can you do about it?

The first step is to build a strong mindset by Expecting and accepting that people will always have opinions of you, the truth is There’s no use in trying to avoid any judgment because it’s simply impossible. And when you expect that people will always have opinions, you become more resilient to criticism.

Another thing to keep in mind is when you are in social situations, STOP TRYING TO READ Other’s MINDs, Those who care about others’ opinions often believe they’re being noticed more than they really are, which is a psychological phenomenon knows as “The spotlight effect”  
But in reality we are all in a midst of our personal accomplishments and humiliating situations that most of us usually focus on what is happening to us as well as how other people see it.

After reading research studies and articles I made an[animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7ofWl5DkI) to illustrate this topic, explaining how our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us . If you prefer reading. I have included important reference links below.

I (22f) am currently experiencing my mental health at an all time low, but in ways I’ve never seen it before. I have strong urges to leave my partner (who I love, and who treats me like gold), I have strong urges to move far away where nobody knows me, or back with my family for comfort. I have what can only be described as “episodes” that span for several days at a time of extreme irritability, a need to be productive, hyperactivity, and anger, immediately followed by ones of exhaustion, depression, and just general lack of interest in anything. I’ve never experienced anything like this until this past year. This is also being added on top of my diagnosed PTSD from a home invasion a few years ago and general depression I’ve had since my teenage years. I feel like I’m losing control of myself and like nobody can help me. I’m going to have a personality assessment next week but I’m worried that they will just tell me I’m making things up or that it’s just my depression, and that they can’t do anything to help.

Everyone I know tells me that they see improvement, but it doesn't feel that way. I'm living in a self-pity party and I don't even stop it. I want to, really, but I can never take the time to get myself in a better mental state. I give others advice that I need to follow, but I never do. I make others feel better just to push down what I feel. And every time I cry, I instantly feel like it's fake. As soon as the tears fall, and I start to shake from sobbing, I snap myself out of it. I don't deserve to cry, even when I'm at my lowest point. I tell myself to quit, and that it's stupid for me to express these emotions. It really does feel fake. I switch from having a panic attack to laughing at my twisted reality. Why should I cry when I'm the one ruining my own life? There are others who have it worse than me anyways, so why feel sorry for myself?

every strange thing that’s happened in the last 24 hours. please read .,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"
14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41518,New,2023,3,Low,0,71,3772,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0
Talked to two hot girls that spoke my native language.

I'm embarrassed because I have to turn down an invitation - again,6,False,False,True,False,1,False,"***TL;DR:*** *My mental health has gotten worse over the past few years, to the point I had to drop out of university. My friends have a hard time grasping the concept of depression and why I cannot keep up with them. They are doing very well in life, both socially and academically. Despite me being in treatment for my mental health, I am not getting better. Therefor, I can't even tell them that I'm making progress healthwise, which feels very bad. While they are hitting milestones in life, I am stuck. I now got invited to a party which I do not intend to attend. I'm embarrassed, because I feel like a failure in life.* 

&#x200B;

Some background information: The friends that I'm talking about in this post are friends from university. I have other friends who struggle with depression themselves too, but this particular situation concerns my friend group from uni.

I've struggled with depression for more than 10 years, but it got really bad about 2 years ago. Since then I haven't been able to keep up with university or my social life. While my friends make progress in life (academically as well as socially), I fall behind more and more. I can't even say what I'm doing wrong because I have tried so hard to improve my mental health. I've been in therapy, on meds, even in the mental hospital and whilst my depression did improve periodically, I always end up severly depressed again (I'm currently still on meds). Last year it got so bad that I had to drop out of university. I don't like my life. I'm not interested in anything anymore, I turn down friends who ask to hang out and barely go outside anymore. Basic tasks like doing the dishes, going grocery shopping and taking out the trash are exhausting. Getting out of bed and eating something other than toast is a huge accomplishment for me nowadays. I dread having to answer text messages and most of the time it takes me a couple of days or weeks to text back - I've always been someone who hated it when people took so long to respond, but now there's so much shame surrounding small talk and answering questions about my health that I procrastinate it. 

About a week ago I got a text from a friend of mine who invited me to her party (which is at the end of this month). Our friend group is going to be there and some people who I haven't talked to since I fell behind in university (I had to retake a bunch of classes and then took a break from uni due to my depression and social phobia getting worse, which is why I now haven't talked to these people in ages). I instantly knew that I wouldn't be going, but I couldn't bring myself to text back because... what would I even reply? Last year I managed to go to two of my friend's birthday parties which were very draining and awkward, even though it was nice to see them again. I'm super grateful that my friends still try to include me, but I can't help but feel so stupid among them... While everyone else shares pictures from their last vacation or talks about their new job or even the house that they're starting to build, I can just sit there and be happy for them, while simultaneously hurting on the inside for being such a failure in life. I have nothing to contribute; nothing to tell them about me - because nothing remotely exciting happens in my life and they don't understand that me not having a job or going to university doesn't mean I get to relax all day and have fun. It's like they can't grasp the concept of depression. 

In the beginning, when I was still able to socialize now and then, my friends would show an interest in my life and ask me how I'm doing every now and then, but they were never able to relate to my situation - which is positive in itself because they're not mentally ill and I'm grateful that they are healthy, but it has also gotten me some comments and questions that kinda stung. For instance, when I had to take a break from university because my mental health was in such a poor condition that getting out of bed was my biggest challenge, one of them straight up asked me ""So what are you doing now all day long?"" implying that I had so much spare time, now that I didn't attend classes. I'm 100% aware that she had no ill intentions and merely asked out of curiosity, but it still felt like such a punch in the gut. And the worst thing is that I didn't even have a proper answer. What do I do all day long? I mostly lay in bed, I cry, I dissociate, sometimes I spend hours doomscrolling on my phone or staring at the wall and if I have a ""good"" day I might be able to go grocery shopping or clean my flat. I've tried explaining to them what I struggle with, but I can tell they don't know how to respond. I've gotten numerous ""Hope you get well soon!""s, which they later followed up by asking if I'm feeling better yet. Obviously mental illnesses are not the same like a cold or a virus, but I know that my friends had good intentions and tried to check in with me. Due to me not attending social events and being unable to do the things they like to do for fun (clubbing, going out to eat or grab drinks), eventually we grew apart. I hardly talk to them anymore, which I think is mostly my fault, but even if I wasn't depressed I wouldn't enjoy big get-togethers or sitting in a busy restaurant to update each other on one's latest achievements (my ADHD makes sensory processing very hard, so bars, clubs and restaurants are truly a nightmare for me and I stopped forcing myself to go there for other people's sake). 

All of them study full time while also holding down a part-time job, yet they still find time for their pets, hobbies and/or relationships - I have none of that. I'm sure they have their own struggles as well; they just can't relate to mine and as a result I feel like I have to defend myself for not keeping up. I've noticed that the reason why I turned down their invitations lately, is that I feel less than them and like an underachiever. Catching up with them leaves me drained and afraid that they'll talk about me behind my back - seeing this written out feels so silly, because they have always been kind to me and never (activitely) made me feel bad for missing out on parties etc.

When I got this text message with the invitation, I instantly felt the urge to explain myself; to ""prove"" that I'm not turning them down because I don't want to hang out with them, but because I'm not well enough to socialize. I guess a part of me is afraid that they'll stop reaching out and I want them to know that I appreciate them thinking of inviting me still (which I always tell them anyway). But I also don't want to give them this false illusion of me being able to attend parties in a few months or suddenly not being depressed anymore. While I do think that I eventually might be interested in meeting friends 1 on 1 again, I don't think I'll ever go back to attending social events that make me uncomfortable due to their nature (busy get-togethers with people talking all over each other, lots of small talk, alcohol, loud music, people I don't know, ...) - but that's the kind of socializing this friend group enjoys! 

I'm embarrassed, because after all this time of being depressed and having gotten all kinds of help, I'm still running in circles while my friends have actual lives and are hitting milestones. My health is not improving and I'm afraid of being misunderstood or judged. Back when we were all going to university together I really enjoyed seeing them every day and loved hanging out with them after class. I think the main difference is that back then we had stuff in common that we could talk about - assignments, papers, sometimes we used to study together and other times we discussed relationship issues or plans for the weekend.

I don't know what to reply to the invitation other than ""I'm not coming"". Should I explain myself (again) and say that I'm not doing well? Should I lie and pretend I'm busy on that day? I have a hard time guessing whether they are even interested in hearing my excuses anymore.

Why are so many therapists just damn awful?,30,False,False,True,False,14,False,"I’ve seen quite a few therapists in my early 20s when I struggled severely with anxiety. I’m much better now, thank god, but when I was in my early 20s it was really really bad.

Is there a name for this anxiety?,22,False,False,True,False,17,False,"I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$& out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i  have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this: 

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain.

I'm broken,3,False,False,True,False,11,False," 

Would you get mad at a starving person for wanting food more than someone who gets three meals every night? Of course not. Stop assuming lonely guys who obsess over women are losers. When a guy who's felt lonely his entire life suddenly has hope that someone he likes might like him back how TF do you think hes gonna feel/perceive it? I shouldn't have to make this distinction but being lonely or single isn't an excuse to hate women or rape or anything like that.

About a month ago, despite me being really really really nervous, I introduced myself to this girl I really liked and we had a great 10 minute conversation. Between her open-ended responses/answers, eye brow raises, and laughs, I thought she was interested in me. Later that day, I asked her if she wanted to get lunch later that week and she said she was busy. Still, because of our first interaction, I was optimistic. Just the thought of me being with her made me so optimistic and happy. When I say that I was obsessed with her I promise you thats an understatement. She's beautiful, friendly, really really smart and it seemed like we had great chemistry. She smiled at me a couple times when walking by in the hallway between now and than but nothing really other than that. Fast forward to today, despite my extreme nervousness I asked her for her number and she said she has a BF. She was really nice about it and I have no hard feelings towards her but :(

I spent 45 minutes in a public bathroom stall crying about this. It felt like a movie. A lonely guy finally getting of his comfort zone and suddenly meeting someone amazing and falling in love. Well, actually, only to find out its not to be. All the hope, nervousness, and thoughts I had about her over the past month or so is now reduced to nothing. If this makes me sound like a loser so be it but I can't be the best version of myself without that special someone. I've never even come close. I'm graduating in June, and I didn't capitalize at all on the best/easiest/most fun/most convenient time to find her. Dating apps suck. Meeting people of the opposite gender irl isn't easy because of the ""elephant in the room"".

Yes I know theres more to life than this and having hobbies/friends are important but people who have always been single are never gonna be able to get over not being in a relationship until it happens for 1. ego reasons 2. love/support 3. CURIOSITY, jesus fucking christ, every song on the radio is about love.

Human beings are social creatures. Also, 31% of guys between the ages of 18-29 are dating but 62% of women in that SAME age group are dating. Uphill battle.

I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support,325,False,False,True,False,97,False,"Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.

I'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.

But somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.

Then on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.

It was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.

I took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.

My manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically ""either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.""

Three of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were ""triggering"" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.

I have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been ""too much to handle"" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just ""feel like a burden"", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.

My support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, ""Great. Scared another one away.""

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.

How do I stop putting my own worth in other people's hands?,67,False,False,True,False,17,False,"Okay so, a little background. I used to be a very shy kid in middle school and was pretty sure that no one besides my group of friends knew of my existence. But one day I found out that these older kids were making fun of me and saying pretty hurtful things about me. This obviously made me feel pretty shitty. Even though I stopped myself from thinking about it too much and eventually forgot about the situation, it still had an impact on my life. I had pretty low self esteem and social anxiety which I've learned to deal with throughout the years. 

I'm now 22 years old and decided I wanted to turn a new page and make a big change in my life. I worked pretty hard and got accepted into a master's degree in another country. This made me very excited because not only is it a degree I really like but it'll give me an opportunity to meet new people, find a new environment and just get a fresh start. 

I don't know why this happened, but I suddenly remembered this whole middle school situation which ""awakened"" some pretty negative thoughts I had in my head. This also led me to do a big mistake and check the social media profile of one of the guys that made fun of me. And I found out he was living in the country I'm moving to, quite close to the city I'll be studying at.

This has been giving me a lot of anxiety. Though I know it's ridiculous for an adult to act the same way they did in middle school I'm still scared I'll find him there and he'll make fun of me. Or that he'll assemble a new group of people to harass me from affar and I won't be able to be myself or make friends. I know these thoughts tend to escalate and that the probability of this happening isn't that high. But my mindset has been really damaged from the situation and I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to give up on going because I worked really hard to get a place there and put a lot of money into it already. 

I also think that the real issue here is that I put my own worth into other people's hands and care too much about what they think. I realize that's a problem and that the solution would be to just accept and love myself fully. But how does one do that? I feel like I do like and take care of myself. But all it takes is a negative comment for all of it to crumble.

How I overcame depression and anxiety without a shrink or medication.,1,True,False,True,False,2,False,"I was about 15, started to not enjoy things I used to. Felt like I was just doing them because thats what I used to do. 

Eventually just felt shitty, didnt know why and knowing I could feel shitty for no reason meant I just kept feeling shittier. Around the same time I was having panic attacks staying over at people houses. Thought about suicide, not seriously but it was like a fantasy.


Saw countless shrinks and tried 5 different SSRIs. Nothing worked.


* Today i'm happier than ever, I'm making new friends constantly and I can pick up girls like second nature.
The turning point for me was [this(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPEdDcs_8ZQ) short documentary. It taught me the power of positive thinking. It sounds stupid but worked better for me than medication and many different psychologists.
What you need to do is stop any negative thought you have as soon as you realise you're having it. Stop it and replace it with a positive one. Dont descend into an introspective debate with yourself about it, just do it. **Doing it will physically rewire your brain to feel more content and think more positively about yourself.** Im reasonably attractive, had been with 7 girls by age 19 (when the turning point happened), I can write a decent 2000 word essay in one day and I used to think I was the biggest hopeless loser in the world. Self esteem is subjective and if you think badly of yourself it's just a bad perspective ingrained into your brain chemistry. It's not objective truth.


* Next step is meditation. Meditation has brought me emotional highs that rival the way I feel when im on drugs. Basically what meditation does is exercise your mind and make it more easy to control. Read about mindfulness meditation and aim for 30-60 minutes a day. Even if you do 5-10 minutes a day it's better than nothing.

* Physical exercise is the one thing that is proven beyond any doubt to improve mental health. Endorphins + watching positive changes to your body = one of the strongest anti-depressive tools you have. You might not want to exercise at first but remember that you're just giving in to depression if you dont do any.

* Psychology is really a very incomplete way of looking at the brain but there are things you can learn about it that will completely change the way you see things and help you understand the way you are.

* Last but absolutely not least is spirituality. You CANNOT be happy and peaceful without strong positive spiritual beliefs. To be clear, if you strongly believe that not following what the bible says will land you in hell, thats a very negative spiritual belief. If you strongly believe there's no god but dont have any other beliefs, thats also a very negative spiritual belief.
An example of a positive spiritual belief is buddhism. It's an atheist religion which teaches that your purpose is to do right by other people. Almost all religions teach the same thing, but buddhism is like a step by step guide to happiness.

* Depression and anxiety are not diseases the way cancer is a disease. You can cure them purely through the way you control your mind. They just are a product of your mind controlling you.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

Sincere honest question; Is the lack of masculinity in modern youth causing more depression in young men?,0,False,False,True,False,3,False,"I've posted  a few videos about this topic before. People can feel free to disagree and that's fine.

What I don't agree with is the admins just deleting the posts because they don't like the message.

So I'm not going post any videos or links.

I'll ask the readers to answer a few honest questions;


If you believe that we genuinely like in a toxic patriarchy and  being ""a straight white male"" gives you more privilege over others.

-Then why are men more likely to suffer from depression and suicide than women?

-Why are white people in rich first world countries often more sad and depression than people in the developing world?

-If ""toxic masculinity"" is such a bad influence on young men, than why are kids who grow up without a father or father figure far more likely to become troubled youths, drop out of school and become involved in crime at a young age?

-If being more effeminate is considered more ""progressive"" and healthy, than why are these type of men more likely to suffer from stress and anxiety and unable to handle emergency situations without having a mental breakdown? For example they may en emotional breakdown if a job interview doesn't go their way, so how can they honestly expect to handle a situation like a road accident?

-If being more effeminate is an ideal trait, then why are women always far more often attracted to more masculine men? Why was something like ""50 Shades of Grey"" a worldwide best seller among women  when it depicts being sexually aggressive and dominating a young woman as positive?


-If being transgender is ""stunning and brave"", essentially a man in the literally sense shedding all masculinity and becoming a woman. Then why are transgender people is far more likely to commit suicide, even far more so than the ""straight white men""? Even ""after"" they go through their transformation?


-Why is it considered ""sexist"" if a female character in a movie or TV show isn't depicted as nothing more over the top ""I can do anything, girl power"" super-duper? Yet, it's always perfectly fine to portray men as bumbling idiots. Whether it's a cocky male hero who causes trouble or the sitcom foolish beta-male TV dad?



-Why is it that I know someone personally who had all of these traits;
--He hated anything heteronormative.
--Considered himself a ""woke male feminist"".
--Would often come across as being pretentious and make left-wing political debates when if we were just out socialising. 
--Would consider all religions and older traditions as ""just for idiots"", yet fall into nihilism.
--Delve into Marxist theory and claim to be on the side of the working class, yet never worked in manual labour a day in his life. Nor bother to setup a small business or volunteer.
--Came across as being effeminate,even prided himself on it and was open about virtue signalling, then complained to other guys about being awkward around women.

He did all of this .......................and he took his own life.


Can you ""h-o-n-e-s-t-l-y"" say that a lack of masculinity isn't causing more problems with men in Ireland and around the world?

Why do I instantly dislike people that are ugly?,1,False,False,True,False,7,False,"I am watching some youtuber i hear their voice and then I see their face maybe they have beard on their neck or are chubby or whatever and I instantly stop being interested in their content. Was I even interested in their content in the first place then ?

I wish I was less prone to things like that i must say, it is annoying. Every single one of youtubers i watch are attractive in some way because I enjoy seeing them you know. And then there are people who are kind of attacking me for that i am sure and I feel like they are probably ugly too in league with the uglies right to make them feel better?

For example I could watch The Click all day you know omg but some neckbeard nahhh i instantly disregard. Same with the women though a little tiny bit better i guess like only a huge dose of fatphobia i guess. I just fucking can't watch obese people they look extremely unhealthy and unattractive you know.

Project Shakti,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"My parents, who emigrated from India to the United States, both worked as farmers to provide me with a brighter future and opportunities they never had. However, they were disappointed to learn of the various challenges I have encountered, despite their best efforts. As a bisexual individual coping with mental illness, I found myself feeling isolated, as my family’s conservative beliefs and immigrant work ethic did not lend themselves to discussing these topics openly. I yearned for the day when I could fearlessly introduce myself as “Ria Patel”, embracing all facets of my identity without the fear of judgement or rejection. But my fears proved unfounded when my parents embraced me with open arms and encouraged me to seek help for my mental illlness, recognizing that living in America could offer hope and the promise of a better future. Thus, I sought out treatment and learned that I was suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression-diagnoses that both confirmed and alleviated my struggles. Receiving my diagnosis brought me to tears, not from sadness, but from validation. The Indian community had made me feel like my mental health struggles were a form of madness, but the diagnosis showed that I had a treatable condition. With renewed purpose, I sought help through therapy and medication, which helped me reclaim my well-being. Yet the question always remained, why am I the only Indian that grappled with these challenges? But I wasn’t the only one. I was one of the few willing to openly discuss the topic. To address this lack of dialogue and raise awareness in South Asian communities, I founded a non-profit organization called Project Shakti. Project Shakti aims to combat the stigma surrounding mental health in South Asian cultures, which stems from a lack of knowledge and understanding about mental illness. Many people in these cultures may not recognize warning signs or may be hesitant to seek help due to misconceptions about mental health being a sign of weakness or shame. As part of Project Shakti's mission to promote engaging mental health education, I established a Redbubble account offering merchandise that promotes awareness of mental illness and a donation page supporting the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Our organization's blog offers multiple perspectives on mental health to combat isolation, while the PS Story podcast shares a teenager's unique perspective on coping with mental illness. Additionally, we are launching a children's book that emphasizes the importance of accepting mental illness at any age. Project Shakti's message of embracing individuality and acceptance deeply resonates with my experiences of navigating the challenges of being diagnosed. I hope to contribute to a community that empowers individuals to celebrate diversity and embrace their unique identities. Because that to me is  embracing the American dream.

"I want to murder, and i don't feel guilty about it.",3,False,False,True,False,4,False,"(sorry if my english isn't that good, i'm not native.)  
I had these feelings years ago for the first time, around maybe 5 years ago.  
My friend got bullied, and that bully said something to me while showing me a butter knife they had.  
they threatened me with it, i wasn't scared but i was angry. I thought about taking the 'knife' and shoving it in her eyes. I didn't ofcourse, it would've gotten me in trouble. But i know if nobody would've known it was me, i would've done it.  


I get these urges sometimes randomly, and sometimes for a reason or two.   
To name an example, about a year and a half ago:  
I had a boyfriend, and i despised him. He was overly sexual, unfunny, unattractive, awkward, didn't know what no meant... i could go on. It was an online relationship aswell, so i couldn't have murdered him.. Wich made me wanna do it more. This is an example of reason.  
And example of no reason would be:  
I got angry for no real reason, atleast no obvious one.  
I first felt the urge to destroy something, then it got worse and worse;  
First i just wanted to kill a dog, i hate dogs. No, i despise dogs.  
They're loud, submissive, annoying, hard to care for.... (sorry not sorry)  
Then i wanted to kill a person. nobody in particular, wich is the biggest difference between reason and no reason. i just wanted to kill, torture... stab..  
It was getting bad to the point i couldn't stop shaking, or fidgeting.  
Don't get me wrong: i fidget and shake all the time, i've gotten used to it. but when this happens its more than usual.  
I've been dealing with these thoughts for a while, but not like theyre on my mind 24/7,  
but they just come back to me with such intensity every like 1-3 months, hold on for 10 minutes until i distract myself, and then go away. Not completely, and the physical effects take a while to return to normal aswell. And usually, it will come again in either the same day, or next day. It can come multiple times a day or two, then go for 1-3 months, and repeat.   


I found out the most common cause of this is relationships, rather it'd be friends or partner.  
As i said, i've dealt with this for a few years now, but it got worse around 2019 and continued getting worse and worse. i think the worst it got was 2022 until now, and i got 2 or 3 of these this year, so maybe 2023 will become the next worst year.  


What do i want from posting this? Multiple things.  
1. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my mind. i never really told anyone about this, due to fear of judgement.  
2. I wanna know whats going on with me, this doesn't feel normal.  
3. Support, i know if i wanna get better, i need support.  
4. Maybe similar stories to help myself understand why i feel this way, and that im not alone.  


What do i absolutely NOT want?  
Telling me i'm a horrible human being, i know that already. I did a lot of fucked up shit because of my mental health and im not excusing myself or distancing myself from all bad actions i've done, but just understand that im torturing myself with my own thoughts already.  


Now , i wanna end this with saying a few things. If there will be any questions - I'll answer them to the best of my ability. If anyone needs support and advice with similar things - I'll do my best to help.  
I  know others and myself included need a space where they can say every bad thing about themselfs,  
Otherwise nobody will become a better human being. It doesn't matter if you're a psychopath, sociopath, if you're neurodivergent, or neurotypical; you should be able to get a space to get better in.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41521,Hot,2023,3,Very low,1,51,3587,negative,negative,False,False,0,1,0

I don’t know if I’m ready to quit vaping yet.

He’s smoked since 17 and switched to vaping in college 5years ago. We quit before and lapsed, a lot of those withdrawls we had serious issues that occurred where tensions were high irritability was high and feelings were neglected . We eventually quit for 3 months or so and that was fine but we lapsed again during stressful holidays. We decided to quit (mostly because we just ran out of juice and know we need to quit eventually) but this time I’m actually feeling the withdrawals whereas before I felt like I just noticed his own withdrawals and tension. I actually felt irritable the last day or two like I didn’t want to be around him, or be triggered by him, or have anything to do with the relationship, I just want to leave and come back in a week but I think that’s because my brain associates him with vaping and it’s my own trigger. I read that avoiding triggers isn’t good and that you just build better habits. We were talking about getting back in the gym. But my fear is that if I go back home (drove out of town while he hangs with a friend tonight) that we’ll get in an argument or I’ll cry again or feel hurt and honestly I don’t feel strong right now. I already felt hurt twice last night and tonight and he chalks it up to him careless use of words and brain fog with his own withdrawls, he’s normally extremely calm and listening without being triggered himself in any way. But with withdrawals he does not hold as much empathy I think because he’s going thru it and can’t give as much.

Regret.,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I feel like my mind is playing this drama in my head, repeating the event over and over again; and then my fear and anxiety are predicting all the awful outcomes. I dated someone for a month last year, he was 32 and I was 22, he manipulated, lied, and was abusive physically and emotionally, hence why it lasted for a month. However he quickly tried to infiltrate every crevice of my life, contacting my mother and brother if I didn’t respond in a timely manner, bringing his 2y/o child to my house unannounced, and ultimately I just feel so much embarrassment and self hate for all the abuse I allowed from him. It haunts me, and am currently getting into therapy.

Basically, he set up his phone to record us being intimate without my knowledge, and then mid way I realized, and told him I didn't want that, and he coerced me into thinking it was fine. I was weak and a people pleaser at the time, so uncomfortably I let it go, as he convinced me it was ""art"" and it didn't matter. I know ultimately it was my fault for not putting up more of a fight, I'm trying not to fall into the victim mentality but l'm just so angry and scared. Mind you, I later found out he keeps photos and videos of every woman he dates and he is so narcissistic and so sick and such a low vibrational excuse of a human that he keeps them all for power and to jack off later to them so he can feel like a king. He also was shorter than me so he had little man syndrome. I asked him to delete it immediately after he took it, he refused. I asked him many times to delete it he didn't say anything. I know even if he “said"" he deleted it that he could be dishonest so there's no point. I'm 23 now and had built up the courage to reach out to him and demand for him to delete the video yet he does not respond, he feels empowered that he's got this over me im sure. I feel so disgusting, I can't forgive myself. I'm preparing legally in case he does release the video, but how would I even find out being that the porn world is over saturated and a complete abhorrent abyss?

What advice would you have for someone who's been struggling with life ruiningly debilitating social anxiety and agoraphobia for over a decade?,5,True,False,True,False,0,False,"I'd appreciate anything that isn't just ""go outside and talk to people.""

That's the gist of it, more context below if it helps but you don't have to read all of it if you want to leave a comment.


I am 25 and in my last semester of school. I have tried a few different medications, including lexapro, zoloft and beta blockers, and none have worked at all and a few have left me with lasting side effects including depression.
Therapy has also not helped. CBT doesn't work on me and I don't know what to even talk about during sessions. The best I've gotten is being told to do breathing exercises or just told stuff about my disorder that I already know.

I've just scraped by academically with a 3.0 GPA and I haven't made a single connection at school, professional or otherwise, in the 6 and a half years I've been here. I've never been employed and I haven't been proactive about my career once in my life due to my mounting anxiety about it, and I've spent all my time either doing homework or just being a depressed vegetable in my room.

I do go on walks pretty regularly, and I have one singular friend who I met on a dating app of all things, and those are probably the only two things that have kept me from going completely insane.

This year I'm finally going to graduate and go out into the real world and I'm terrified out of my mind. I go to an art school, ended up taking a long time to graduate due to dropping out once and switching majors twice, and I'm just about the most mediocre artist imaginable considering the education I've had and all the time I've put into it. I am not all that optimistic about job prospects.

I also have either adhd or autism, undiagnosed and relatively mild, which combined with years of near complete isolation have left me horrifically socially maladjusted.

Ultimately, despite the dramatic post title it's not like I'm totally catastrophizing about my life. I'm disappointed in how things turned out, how anxiety has kept me from achieving most of my goals, about all the missed opportunities and wasted potential, but I've had years to come to terms with it. As for my career, even if I start off with a shitty job or unpaid internship I do have a little bit of a safety cushion thanks to my parents, & I don't think I'm gonna end up homeless. Like, I'll be fine.

Still, I'm just looking for any advice at all on how to make things better. I've accepted the way things are but it doesn't mean I'm resigned to staying the same forever. Anyways even if you don't have any advice, thank you for reading to the end.

Edit: Thank you for this amazing response. Definitely put a perspective on things. These are the best tips that I came across after reading almost all the comments that might help:
1. Share something ONLY after they've shared something equally vulnerable.
2. Consciously realize when you're sharing something personal and stop to ponder whether it's the right choice. 
3. Therapy!!
4. Keep a core group of friends in front of whom you can dump anything, everyone else is a no no.
5. Train yourself to resist talking about yourself all the time just to make a connection.

"""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"" by Mark Manson: A Counterintuitive Guide to Living a Good Life",0,False,False,True,False,0,False,"[ Photo by Amauri Mejía on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/pvwp8a8cr4wb1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=720943e2b35f69ebc073e0f56257310ee886e2e8)

 

A best-selling self-help book by Mark Manson called [“The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck”](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) questions accepted ideas about happiness and personal development. Manson advises embracing life’s inevitable hardships and deciding what is actually important to us rather than making unending positive promises. The main ideas and takeaways from the book are outlined in this synopsis.

**1. The Problem with Positivity**

Manson starts by criticizing the modern self-help sector’s fixation with optimism and never-ending joy. He contends that the search for eternal happiness is unachievable and frequently results in unhappiness and anxiety.

**2. The Inevitability of Suffering**

The idea that sorrow and difficulties are a part of life from the beginning is presented in the book. [Manson](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) advises accepting these difficulties as a necessary component of the human experience rather than avoiding or ignoring them.

**3. The Value of Selective Suffering**

Manson talks about the idea of “selective suffering,” in which we get to pick and choose what matters and what doesn’t. He underlines how crucial it is to choose our objectives and ideals carefully.

&#x200B;

**4. The Importance of Values**

The book challenges readers to identify their core principles and determine what matters most to them. Finding personal values enables people to focus their attention on what matters and let go of issues that are less crucial.

**5. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck**

Manson contends that [“Not Giving a F\*ck”](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) does not imply indifference or apathy. It entails making decisions about what to hold dear and what to let go of. It involves accepting accountability for one’s life and morals.

**6. The Feedback Loop from Hell**

A sequence of unfavorable feelings and ideas known as the “Feedback Loop from Hell” develops when issues are attempted to be ignored or suppressed. Manson suggests ending this cycle by accepting challenges and overcoming them.

**7. Accepting Responsibility**

The value of accepting responsibility for one’s life is emphasized in the book. [Manson](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) thinks we should stop blaming other factors and instead pay attention to our own decisions and deeds.

**8. Embracing Uncertainty**

Manson talks about how uncomfortable uncertainty can be and urges readers to accept it as a necessary component of life. Growth and resilience depend on the capacity to accept unpredictability.

**9. The Importance of Action**

The key to personal development is to act, even in the face of doubt or fear. The book gives readers advice to make slow, steady progress toward their values.

&#x200B;

**10. Rejection of Victimhood**

Manson rejects the notion of being a victim and emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for oneself. He exhorts people to take charge of their reactions rather than viewing themselves as victims of their situations in life.

**11. The Subtle Art of Failure**

Manson investigates the notion that failure is a crucial component of success. Avoiding failure at all costs is not as effective as failing and learning from it.

**12. The Importance of Emotions**

The importance of accepting and comprehending our emotions is emphasized in the book. [Manson](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) contends that feelings offer insightful feedback about our objectives and ideals.

**13. Death as a Motivator**

Manson introduces the idea of mortality motivation, according to which realizing how short our lives are can inspire us to live honestly and uphold our morals.

**14. The “Do Something” Principle**

[Manson](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) contends that it is frequently ineffective to wait for motivation before acting. Instead, he advises taking baby steps to get motivated and move in the right direction.

**15. The Value of Feedback**

We may develop and become better by asking for input from others. Manson promotes using constructive criticism as a tool for self-improvement and being open to receiving it.

**16. Rejection of External Validation**

The book advises against looking to the outside world for approval of our decisions and deeds. Manson encourages self-validation based on one's own beliefs because external validation is a road to unhappiness.

**17. The Tyranny of Exceptionalism**

Manson criticizes the culture’s fixation with excellence. He exhorts people to accept their limitations and enjoy life’s everyday experiences.

**18. The Importance of Connection**

Manson talks about the value of interacting with people and forming deep bonds. He contends that cultivating genuine connections and a focus on common ideals might result in a richer life.

**19. The “Four Subtle Counterintuitive Truths”**

Manson presents four counterintuitive truths:

* Happiness eludes us more and more, the harder we try to find it.
* Accepting pain can make you happy.
* We are not unique, and neither are our issues.
* The pursuit of pleasant experiences may result in unpleasant ones.

**20.** [**The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck**](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) **in Practice**

The book provides guidance on how to put its principles into practice in real life. Clarifying values, acting, and embracing discomfort are all part of this.

**In Conclusion**

The provocative manual [“The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck”](https://amzn.to/4974pJ7) offers advice on how to lead a more genuine and happy life. By promoting the acceptance of life’s inevitabilities and the selective pursuit of ideals that genuinely matter, Mark Manson undermines the conventional self-help method.

Let's Debate: Modern Psychiatry Does Far More Harm Than Good,1,False,False,True,False,65,False,"To begin, I am schizoaffective (or so they say). I have been forcefully put into a ward 5 separate times, each for a month each. I have not been hospitalized since 2015. Despite being prescribed medication for life, I have abstained from taking them and have yet to experience a lack of contact with ""reality"". Any psychiatrist throughout history would advise that I take my meds, which make me a zombie. Plainly a zombie. So here is my thesis:  


 Skepticism in regards to modern medicine and specifically psychiatry could be further expanded upon that beyond the pathologizing of suicide and erratic behavior in children, or depression of being a good person in a bad world and chalking all these things up to entirely genetic chemical imbalances, the powers that be other pathologize what might be, and very likely is - a spiritual undertaking of the inner soul to be not only stigmatized, but repressed to the point of the individual being treated being put out of society forever due to the repressive nature of the basal medical treatment. And that's pretty wack actually.  
\-  
To completely ignore the causation based in systemic societal issues and putting the onus then on a case by case, genetic and entirely physical science sort of treatment, the people are not only at the whim of what the psychiatrists want for them, they are at the whim of the stigma that goes with the illness they are diagnosed with.  
So modern psychiatry rather than ever curing anything in any sense, instead places a bandage on the wound and refuses to ever take it off, thereby letting the wound be hidden from the public eye, and impossible to fix.",False,False,mentalhealth,443576,Controversial,2019,2,Medium,1,60,1642,negative,negative,False,False,0,0,1

Abusive Teachers In High School,1,False,False,True,False,5,True,"TW: s*xual harrasment/assault, p********ia, neglect, and bullying.
Hello i’m new here. I have flashbacks and nightmares of the traumatic experience i went through in High School. I used to think most traits of my teachers (expect for Algebra, Studio Art, US History, and American Sign Language) we’re normal and didn’t see them as abusive. Sometimes i’ll have dreams that are odd or ones i don’t remember. I tend to get paranoid a lot and when i have flashbacks i freeze up and sigh frequently.

my algebra teacher during my sophomore year was hell. she would be strict and wouldn’t go over something, she’s the reason i had resource. she wouldn’t go over something and was very mean. during a math problem in order to teach she would talking about beating up a student in the class and taking their money, said to a student if they didn’t run to the bathroom she would run in after them, and one time she threatened to drown a classmate with a super soaker. my english 10 teacher during my sophomore year, one time she smacked her butt in front of the class (she told the class not to report her), she pretended to hit on a classmate and gave the class naughty looks. she also threatened to force feed me and hit me in my front of my mom. she touched me in class one time i told her i didn’t like it and she laughed it off like a joke and threatened to send me to detention for something minor. the teacher gave out candy. in 10th grade in my global class, i had a teacher who would look at me mostly, not the entire class, one time she said she was gonna one of my classmates. she passed out candy and donuts. she has two sons.

during my junior year, my cinema/film teacher would leave the class unattended for large chunks of time, she walk out of class, leaving them in unattended. during my junior year my studio art teacher was a bully, when i was having anxiety she would tell me i’m just exaggerating and told me to stop. she berated me for my drawing skills, i switched out of her class, she was overbearing, she didn’t let the class have a free day, she overworked them, no breaks. ironically she wanted students to add value to their art but she didn’t value their feelings. during my junior year my us history teacher was a narcissist. she thinks people with depression or having a hard time are wanting attention. she smiles if people got mad, it looked narcissistic. she pulled me out of the classroom and threatened to call my mom for disrespecting her but i was sticking up for a classmate who did nothing wrong, she yelled at them. i feel bad for anyone who has to deal with her she denied me a piece of candy for being scared when she approached me. i was the shy emo kid (i am still am emo but not shy) in my school. she wanted students to bottle up their emotions and not get things off their chest to anyone. she kicked out students for petty reasons. i hated her. one time she whispered in my science teacher's ear while she and her smiling at me. one time i told my us history teacher i missed the bus the to go home the previous day i told her it came back to get me, she said she could’ve taken me home (made me feel uncomfortable).

during my senior year i had a resource teacher who would call me sassy just for voicing how i feel about something. during my senior year, i had an american sign language teacher who would never teach. like during a test she never taught next in sign language so during a test/quiz i would either be done or stuck on the first question. you can ask to use the bathroom and be gone the entire class she won’t even care or notice she'd be on her computer. you can walk out and she’ll just ask who left. on the last day before school was cancelled she didn’t let anyone use the bathroom all because one classmate wasn’t paying attention to her. she moved my seat to where i did not feel comfortable, she refused to move me back until 2 months later and she threaded to call my mom because i made a valid point. i had an english 12 teacher who said she was teasing me (made me feel uncomfortable). she called me a nickname (she did a lot of times) i did not like, one day i ignored her and she threatened to call my mom, i got mad, and she kicked me out of the class, she said she called me the name because she was teasing me. whenever i told her about my american sign language teacher (she wasn’t a good teacher), she would tell me to stop complaining saying i’m just exaggerating, so stopped venting to her. she did hand out candy every friday. she also touched me the year before she was my teacher and it made me feel uncomfortable. she said if i go to the parent teacher, she’ll tell my mom things about me, implying if i didn’t go, my english teacher would’ve said bad things about me to my mom.

I was a kid who had to clean all the time, had chores, cooked, had to have straight A's while taking care of my (step) sister and having depression and panic attacks (later found out I have been SA'd as a kid) even had to go to school sick. I also had peed my bed a lot and had nightmares and she yelled at me and made me clean my bed and go back to sleep and school the next day. 
I also had ED because she either didn't allow me to eat or just mad me feel so horrible about my body because of her comments. 
I was only allowed 1 hour of screen time as a teen, no friends, nothing... I snapped at her because I was so sick of it... I wasn't even allowed therapy... she withdrew all my money a day before my 18th birthday and kicked me out. everyone else in my family thought my mom was right because I slept a lot and started having bad grades in school due to depression and very bad anxiety. I was so alone and lonely. 

when I was 21 she came to my work and invited me back home. but it didn't last long because she didn't change and I knew how horrible she was. I ended it. 

When me and my sister came back into contact she constantly asked me for advice but never asked me how I am etc. then we started arguing and she kept saying that I was the problematic child and how I hated her as a kid and how I was abusive and that everything was and is my fault. She just said: ""mom did some bad things but so did you"" she never acknowledged that mom knew about the SA and didn't do anything about it and made it hush hush... she blames me for everything and makes me feel so bad... she even threw it under my nose that if mom was so bad that why did I come back...

Looking for advice on which beta blocker medication I should request my doctor for the treatment of physical anxiety and if this is a good idea in the first place,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"Looking for advice on which beta blocker medication I should request my doctor for the treatment of physical anxiety and if this is a good idea in the first placeI am a 23 year old male dealing with anxiety disorder and i also have asthma. I am currently on mirtazapine and as needed clonazepam and am in therapy. I like this treatment plan as I am quite hesitant on trying ssri's since I really do not want the sexual side effects/potential PSSD and also because the main side effects of mirtazapine (increasing appetite and making you go to sleep) are actually benefits in my case as my anxiety completely kills my appetite and gives me insomnia if I dont take something sedative.

I have been making pretty good progress compared to where I was a month ago but I feel as though the last thing which is truly holding back my progress is physical anxiety which appears unconsciously in high stimulus situations or in stressful social situations. Mentally I'll be fine and have no rational thing im afraid of but its like my body just fails me : my breathing will get really tight making it hard to even talk and my heart rate starts going insanely high which brings on a whole host of other debilitating physical symptoms. All this can often cause me to spiral into a full blown panic attack where I sometimes have no choice but to excuse myself and call an uber home.I have read that low dose beta blockers are sometimes used with great success in treating exactly this and so I wanted to request this from my doctor tomorrow. 

I am looking for one which can preferably be taken on an 'as needed' basis and which does not interfere with asthma or with the asthma medication that I take daily (simbicort).

Concerned about acquaintance with mental illness talking about violence,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"Hey everyone, just looking for some advice. I have an old acquaintance from high school who unfortunately appears to be struggling with some pretty serious mental health issues. I’ve spoken to him a handful of times directly since I last saw him, and he’s gotten extremely paranoid/delusional - I won’t go into too much detail, but he talks very frequently about the CIA/FBI implanting listening devices and controlling his thoughts, lots of stuff like that.

I don’t know the guy *that* well, so when I’ve seen him I’ve usually just figured that it’s not my place to try to convince him to get help (as far as I know his family has tried relentlessly), but he recently started posting some more concerning stuff which is what I want to get some opinions about:

In some recent posts he made, he started talking about how the voices are trying to make him kill someone, but he doesn’t want to. Up until this point, the stuff he would say/post usually just concerned himself, as in, he would talk about how bad stuff was supposedly happening to him, but he never mentioned harming anyone/anything else. I found the recent shift pretty alarming, but after hearing stories about mentally ill people being hurt/killed by police I was hesitant to immediately call 911. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations about potential resources that I could share this stuff with, both for his safety and for the safety of the public? He hasn’t acted violent toward anybody to my knowledge, and I recognize that the vast majority of mentally ill people aren’t a threat, but considering his apparent state of mind I can’t help but find it very alarming to see him talking about this sort of thing.

Hi there so here it is me and a partner have fallen pregnant we found out recently she was. We had talked prior about this and agreed if it happened abortion would be the route due to us having almost nothing to our names in any aspect of life. She has since changed her mind and understandable that is her choice. But the issue is I’ve only recently come out of 18 years of trauma and abuse leading to complex emotional trauma and issues. Now in all this I sought out therapy for us and myself to help us come to some terms and get some info. We’ve been informed that due to my complex issue of the child is kept I will be emotionally a wreck for up to ten years. Multiple professionals have said out of the options aborting or me leaving would lead to the least damage for both parties involved. Obviously there’s pain in all of those for both parties, if I am to leave that’s a pain and guilt I will have added but my partner and child won’t have to handle what the professionals strongly believe will happen to me mentally. I’m just so stuck because I love my partner and want them but have been told that staying I will to no direct fault just due to the complexity of the issues cause pain and hardship on them through the up to decade I’ve been told it will take to work through all of my issues. So now I’m faced with leaving and carrying that pain but knowing she’d have happiness in the child and her life or somehow us finding a resolution on aborting although obviously I understand it’s her choice and if she truly can’t then we seem to understand me not being in the picture is sadly for the best.

how do i stop assuming patterns? please read im begging,9,False,False,True,False,5,False,"i know the title isnt very eye-catching. so i hope at least one person can read this. i dont know how to explain it to you, but im a very “pattern-oriented” person. almost all the things i assume, observe, and recognize is because i constantly arrange it into a pattern. 

ex: (this person) acts like (this) because (this) and ive recognize (this and this etc)

i understand this (topic) because I’ve recognized (this) and (this) and therefore (this) may happened because of (all of those observations) 

the problem with this pattern thing is that it makes me assume my life is a pattern as well. 

ex: if i had a bad month last year january, then i’ll likely have it bad again this year. 

if i did amazing for last year’s 1st school term but did bad at the 2nd term, then it’ll probably happen again. 

if a relationship failed at august last year, then another will bound to fail again this year’s august.

because of this, i start assuming something bad will happen. and i guess thats normal to assume. everyone uses experiences to learn and try to avoid things. the problem is im really trying to just be more positive. these “negative” things wreck me and make me assume something bad will happen and because of my anxiety with that, i end up spiraling and maybe even leading myself back again to that “pattern” that i “assume would happen”. 

another is a make myself do certain “things/actions” in order to avoid “an event” i completely assumed in my head and i think that if i dont do it, something bad will happen. 

ex: if i dont put my snake ring facing upwards then im going it have a bad day because the last time i didnt i had a bad day.

I identify more with 'victim' than with 'survivor',258,False,False,True,False,63,False,"Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. 

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over.

Like I want to do something anything about all my circumstances but my body just can’t take action when I go to do anything more than conjure the thought. I’ve had smaller waves of depression before but this has been an entirely different experience. Stressed from being fired, bored of video games, bored of job applications, angry at life, angry at God, angry with myself, scared from anxiety I never had till recently that’s not going anywhere anytime soon seemingly and that’s been kicking my ass! Scared I’m losing my optimism for a brighter day, scared that I’ve never been this close to not believing in myself anymore. I tell myself I simply need to just get it together and that sounds good in my head at times, but then Ill get so overwhelmed out of nowhere and just breakdown, all while realizing how little it took for that to happen because I seen a guy on the street that resembles someone or a car drive past, or just seeing another person smile. And I conclude to myself that I’m clearly not ok. Which isn’t ok lol, because I’ve always been ok and now I’m not and I don’t know where to go or to look and it feels like the walls are closing in and I can’t breathe. I was watching Suits the other day and Harvey had an anxiety attack in the show, just the depiction of his attack triggered me so much because it was so accurate to mine the past few months. I’ve never had this or expected this to arise, feel like I’m losing slight control over something in the moment idk what or how to explain. And I snap on anyone about anything because I’m so frustrated with everything. I don’t wanna think, or do. So therefore I sleep. It doesn’t help, I open my eyes to the same reality I tried to leave when I closed them.

I want to cry at times to let it out but then immediately feel weak for crying rather than taking some sort of other action instead in that moment to fix anything.

Bipolar ,1,False,False,True,False,0,False,"I have been bipolar my whole life. I only recently knew what it was. I was always under the impression that bipolar had to do with anger not sadness like depression. However I don't feel sad I feel worthless, empty, a waste of time and energy. Just a complete failure and never gets any better. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 10 and I'm 24 I've taken antidepressants they never really help. I want a more permanent solution I don't want to feel like I'm better of dead for the rest of my life. Everything always gets harder for me I fail a lot with everything.

1. My love life is garbage all my closet friends have girlfriend, wives, or sleep around a lot. I can't even get a woman to think of me more than a friend or an emotional support bestie. I really haven't ever been a relationship, but once and it wasn't one she only used me for money. My name is her contacts was ""Free Shit 🤑"" I never notice until I started reflecting she never called me my real name only my nickname. I fail so much at it yet I only blame myself. I can't even cry about because I always think of someone's been through so much worse my pain is so little like I don't matter.(This toxic behavior is probably what ruined my brain)

2. I can never keep down my weight the most I ever lost was 40lbs and gaing back so fast I'm 24 6'1 and 365.6lbs I'm morbidly obese. I get happy for bit lose a little weight (3 - 5lbs) then some how I just get knocked down from my high/positive streak by life and I binge it so I don't feel numb over indulging in the enjoyable of eating something delicious. Sometimes all food taste the same it not even in enjoyable when you feel hollow.

3. I can never keep a job I don't feel like myself without employment and financial security and I never had it ever. I work my ass off when ever get a job and my employer takes and advantage of that they don't pay me more they just make me hustle for the same scraps. Until I can't do it anymore and burn myself out then out of nowhere I get much less hours and less pay or just get let go. No matter how hard I work I'm always first on the chopping block. 

I have more but this is getting too long. Overall I hate myself and I don't know how to change or get better. I barely can remember my past and I think it my minds way of protecting itself so I don't break out in tears. I don't think much about anything when I'm thinking I think about nothing my concentration is worthless.

I try but I don't have enough discipline to stay comment I quit on myself more than anything. When I ask for help I'm always overshadow... I have made an attempt at my life before and I'm getting dangerously close to trying again. The worst part this time I have nothing stopping me from wanting to not die.

I have to get a surgery soon and am worried how it's going to affect me after. Will it make me manic or will it cause me to go too low? What happened for you? Or did you have to do any med changes or adjustments leading up to or after the surgery?

Deleting social media was one of the best things I’ve done for my depression.,164,True,False,True,False,26,False,"*Edit: This helped me, but everyone’s situation is different. If you’re in a situation where you feel as if you can go without social media, I encourage you to try going without it. :)*

I was addicted to Facebook and Instagram. I mean, I had nothing better to do with my time, or so I thought. I would lay in my bed and scroll through FB for hours upon hours, just looking at all the posts.

The problem: I was worsening my depression by comparing my life to other’s. I didn’t recognize it until I deactivated my social media accounts, but I was living my life through other people’s lives. Constantly telling myself, “That is where you should be “, “That could be you, but you decided to do ______”, “You are nothing compared to the people you grew up with”, “You will never be as successful as _____”. It was truly toxic.

I have MDD, so I’m always depressed, but January through starting Ketamine therapy in late February, I went through one of the worst depressions I’ve ever had. I had suicidal thoughts everyday, multiple times a day. My intrusive thoughts were taking over. I had to quit my job, that I loved, because I had no motivation, and the thought of killing myself was always on my mind (I worked in a funeral home—not the best place for someone suicidal). So, with no job and no motivation to get out of bed, I stayed on FB and Insta... that was where I went wrong. I truly, TRULY believe that social media is toxic for anyone’s mental health. You only see the good, never the bad. You always see the success, never the failures.

After talking to my husband, I chose to delete my FB and Insta. Not going to lie, it was hard, really hard. For the first week I would find myself opening up the folder where the apps used to be. I would think of something and think, “That would be a good status”. It was a constant battle with myself to not re-download the apps. 

Now I’m 3 months without social media, and I feel a weight is lifted off my shoulders. I don’t have to try to fake an amazing life, or take 60 selfies to try to get the perfect profile picture. Most importantly, I don’t have to compare myself to others. Do I still get jealous of other people? Absolutely, but I don’t have to see them constantly update how ‘fabulous’ their lives are.

If you’re struggling with depression, and use social media to cope, I 100% recommend trying to step back for a few days, even a week, and see how it makes you feel.

The only word I can use to describe it is free... I feel free.",False,False,depression_help,93515,Top,2021,5,High,0,77,2495,positive,negative,False,False,0,0,1
"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting",256,False,False,True,False,59,False,"I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""".

Went to the store today for the first time on my own volition (story),10,False,False,True,False,0,False,"So today I (19M) wanted to head down to this Giant Eagle close to my college campus to pick up a Visa gift card. I gathered 55 dollars and made my way to the car. I debated whether I should go but was like fuck it, I’m gonna at least drive done there (I have a bit of driving anxiety too). So I made it in the parking lot and I think “Hm, I’ll glad I drove done there but maybe I’ll just drive back to campus.” Then I was just like fuck it, and went inside. I searched for my gift card, which took a little bit of searching but I finally got it and went to a cashier. I didn’t want to do the self checkout because I’m illiterate with that kind of technology and didn’t have my debit card on me. But I finally got up to the cashier and paid, she said it was 55.95 and I said ok and starting putting my cash in, only to realize I didn’t have enough lmao. So I told her, she didn’t seem too thrilled but I guess also not mad. She just had to abort the transaction and I got my money back. 

I thought about maybe gathering more money and going back but turned down the idea. I’ll probably do that tomorrow.

Some stories were sad, but I was told that one story was so horrific that it caused trauma (ex: the behavior I mentioned above). And the darkness of the story was something his mind had been trying to process but to no avail.

A Deer in Headlights ,1,False,False,True,False,1,False,"I feel like a deer caught in the headlights, completely lost and confused. It's as if I'm a bewildered buck trying to navigate the concrete road of life. The lush green grass and thriving forests of possibilities taunt me, tempting me to taste the fruits of life. But just as I gather the courage to cross, I catch a glimpse of a semitruck racing towards me with blinding lights. Its cargo carries anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, weighing down the suspension of the trailer. I'm paralyzed, unable to move in time. I no longer recognize myself. I remember a time when I was happy, before I joined the Army. I had friends, a social life, and dreams for the future. Unfortunately, everything changed after I took that oath. I've blocked out so many memories, as they cut the deepest. I'm terrified of experiencing happiness. It feels like a tornado, overwhelming and powerful, but once it's gone, all that remains is destruction, death, and shattered foundations. I no longer feel human. I turned 27 last month, an age where most people have a spouse, children, a career, a family, friends, aspirations, and a social life. But these things no longer interest me. When I look around, all I see is evil, hatred, and sorrow. Who would want to invest in this hellish existence? I know some argue that there is still good in the world, but I believe that perception is reality in today's age, and perception is often manipulated. Just like how a seemingly perfect couple may be struggling with infidelity or how some charities only allocate a small percentage of their funds to their mission. I suppose I've lost all my optimism. What's the point of anything if the outcome is always the same? Life is short, and whatever comes after is eternal. I've lost interest in my hobbies at an alarming rate. I used to escape reality by listening to music or playing video games, but even those no longer bring me solace. I can't bring myself to talk to my family because I feel ashamed. It's as if it would have been better if I had never existed in the first place. I'm trying my hardest to live the most non-existent life possible. My fear of abandonment prevents me from forming and maintaining friendships. On top of that, I think I've developed cherophobia. Social anxiety keeps me trapped inside my apartment, unable to leave. I often find myself frozen on the sofa, staring at the door, terrified at the thought of visitors. Whenever someone knocks, it feels like my heart is about to explode, and I immediately retreat to the bathroom for hours. Even going grocery shopping becomes a procrastination game for me. I despise being around people and only venture out when absolutely necessary, usually at night. I don't feel suicidal, but I genuinely wish I had never existed. I've been fighting to be ""normal"" for years, and I'm exhausted. I'm completely worn out. Everything feels so draining. I've given up on life and can't find a reason to keep trying. All I can do now is eat, sleep, take my medication, and count the days. I'm just a deer stuck on the highway.

I feel like I can’t enjoy some things anymore,1,False,False,True,False,4,False,"Idk I’ve just been feeling like I don’t get as much joy out of a couple of things that I used to enjoy.

Some of the feelings that I used to get when I would do certain things aren’t there anymore. It's mostly just small things like watching a show that I like or playing games that I once enjoyed. I just don’t get as much enjoyment from them as before, I just feel empty, and I’m kinda scared that I will never enjoy them again or that it will just get worse for other things as well.

It’s like I have a bad habit of not enjoying the moment. Like I don’t really notice how happy I was until I no longer feel that way, and then I just end up feeling empty and a little painfully nostalgic, like I want to go back to finding joy in things like I once did.

I try to force myself to enjoy things the same way I once did but for some reason it just feels wrong now, like I'm trying to pretend to feel in a way that I no longer do.

Does it go away on its own and will I be able to enjoy things like I once did or am I supposed to just find new things to enjoy? I don't want to let go of the things I once liked but I'm scared that I'll never be able to enjoy them the same way again, and that I'll just have to keep finding new things to enjoy just for the sake of not feeling empty anymore.",False,False,MentalHealthSupport,41518,New,2023,3,Very high,0,45,1290,positive,positive,False,False,0,0,0

My parents are pissing me off because they want to leave my BLIND dog home alone while we are on vacation,16,False,False,True,False,10,False,"Let me explain. I 18m have a 9 year old Siberian Husky that recently went blind. She is getting used to being blind but still bumps into things. It's been hard for me as I am the one who cares for her the most. It not like me family doesn't care at all but they see it as not that big of a deal.

Now the issue is that in a few hours we are supposed to leave for vacation. It is a 12 hour drive and we will be gone for 4 days. We don't take our dog with us because we are going to Vegas and it's too hot for her to handle. I was not planning on going because I want to stay here with my blind dog and care for her. I am worried she will bump into things and get hurt since she is still adapting to being blind. My parents were on board with it in the beginning but now they are demanding I go with them. I do want to go on vacation but I care more about my dog and I won't enjoy the vacation since I will just be worried the whole time. My parents also want to leave my dog outside while we're gone. She has a heated dog house but she probably won't be able to find it SINCE SHE CANT SEE ANYTHING. I can't imagine how terrified she'd be.

Maybe I am overreacting. My parents did talk to our neighbors and asked them to feed and check up on her so that's a plus. And for those wondering why I don't just stay since I am 18, it's because I have Mexican parents who don't care if l'm 18 or 31 and I apparently have to do what l'm told because I live under their roof. I also have no job so l have to do what they say even more.

I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS. I have severe anxiety so I will not be comfortable leaving my dog. I simply will not enjoy one second. When I was little my parents would leave our dog in the yard when we went on vacation. It’s not like my parents don’t love the dog. She is extremely loved.

[PSA/Rant] Research vs self-diagnosis,112,False,False,True,False,24,False,"This is a PSA/rant on learning about your mental health issues and getting a proper diagnosis.

I, like many of you, have suffered silently for many years before seeking out professional help and being diagnosed. In my case, it has taken just over a decade and for many others, undoubtedly much longer than that. For me, the reason was a mix of all or at least the overwhelming majority of my family and friends (whom I, eventually, after many years opened up to or seek help from) not accepting or believing my problems and/or not knowing how to help me. Not to say there haven't been people who have helped me immensely, but hear me out...

This lack of help, knowledge and skills, lead me to do my research on mental health issues and eventually come to find specific issues which I felt were very close to what I have been dealing with day-to-day. It is my understanding that mental health issues often lead to developing other mental health issues, and that there is usually a large overlap of symptoms between a lot of these issues.

In my search, I often came across the advice to not self-diagnose, and while I think it is wise to be doubtful of my judgement knowing that I am not a trained professional, I also disagree with what I felt was usually implied by the above advice, which is to assume that you are probably wrong until you are properly diagnosed by a professional.

I know that for some, it can become a problem. It's easy to look up the symptoms of the probably thousands of known mental health illnesses and with how many symptoms overlap, it is no doubt easy to mistakenly diagnose issues incorrectly and to go down that rabbit hole.

But I also know that it has been quite helpful for me to learn about different mental health issues and to come across issues that I was later diagnosed with.

I think knowing what my issues were (in my opinion) most likely to be helped me in a lot of different ways.

For one, mental health struggles can make you feel extremely lonely and alone and knowing what I might suffer from helped me feel a little more accepted and less like I was the only one and like I was making it all up, something that's been a huge doubt for me ever since I came to learn that I had mental health issues years ago.

Secondly, I was able to learn from the many great online resources that are available and to find out about things that have helped others in a similar situation to me and how to better deal with my problems.

Something else that doing my research helped me with later on was accepting that I had lots of mental issues and that they are quite severe. I know that if my research hadn't prepared me for that, I would have had a much harder time accepting that.

In conclusion, I think that while you obviously should not take your guesses as a professional diagnosis, it's perfectly ok to do your research and to bring yourself some comfort and a sense of acceptance by learning more about the issues that you suspect you may have.

I'm not sure if I was quite able to put my thoughts into words here, but I had some advice that I wish I could've given my younger self and that is not to be scared to learn about what you think your problems could be if you find that helpful and I thought that maybe someone out there will be able to take my advice and benefit from it.

This week, went to the hospital and did a full body check up. MRI, blood test, eye test. You name it, i did it. All the results came in great. Doctors said i am in top shape. 

Issue is, i feel high and spaced out even when i am completely sober. 

I had the biggest panic attack on Tuesday after getting into traffic while driving. This made me go to the emergency room. Again results came in just fine. 

Why am I feeling like this? Why do i feel high when i am sober? 

This feeling is ruining my social life, my business life, my love life. I just want to stay in bed.  

Will it ever go away?

long story short, i was in football training for my team last tuesday (so a week and a half ago now) and i had a massive panic attack on the pitch. i started sobbing and screaming that i couldn’t breathe and i fell to the floor. it was so fucking embarrassing. my manager essentially dragged me off of the pitch and told everyone to have a water break. i heard him say ‘this is what i mean, she’s not-‘ and that’s all i heard because i started crying harder at hearing that. i’ve taken two training nights off because i didn’t feel emotionally stable enough to go, but now i’ve agreed to go tonight because i was scared if i missed any more i would be kicked off the team, but now i feel genuinely sick.

part of the reason i had that panic attack is because lately, a lot of my teammates have been talking to me really condescendingly, kind of like i’m five years old. i’m a lot younger than most people on the team so that kind of dynamic is to be expected a little bit, but this is just insulting. i’m too scared to admit anything to my coach because he can be harsh and rather reactive, and because of a previous incident from a couple of months ago, i’m currently not in his good books.

Me trying to address the situation really is more about preventing me from going the fuck off on anyone. Honestly, I try to be kind. Compassion is one of my biggest values but I can match energy.

My life has been ‘frozen’ for (I can’t believe it) nearly 5 years now .. and I think it’s perfectionism,2,False,False,True,False,0,False,"
I vividly remember starting Year 12 and wondering whether I should switch FM for biology. 

“By next Thursday I’ll decide”

The thought persisted pretty much throughout sixth form (January 2020) - not strong enough though - due to my indecisiveness. Now I don’t care since i finished my A levels in 2020 with A*AAA.

Before that, I remember going on an open day with my older brother to imperial and we visited the history and science museums and it was great but I still felt down because I didn’t know what I wanted to do for uni and I wanted to focus on that. I didn’t even want to go the the cinema because I wanted to figure out and map out my life before I enjoyed it. 

LITTLE has changed. 

I say frozen because I didn’t sabotage my academics / schooling but pretty much everything else has (my friendships, enjoying life) as if I’ve just been the passenger to the bus that is my life. 

And I say perfectionism because I like all things stem but at the same time I’m reluctant to set my heart on anything even now. Another example is me with buying things “for life”. I’ve spent weeks looking for a really good steam iron for my mum but I’ve spent too much time because I want to get the best and my mind won’t feel satisfied until I do. 

The one thing that keeps me sane is realising and understand my life is just one of many millions, and at the end of the day we are all insignificant and will die. But at the same time I’m thinking so much about mine. It’s like either I’m depersonalised or I’m trying to think about too much.

But still I felt like I needed more support or at least some sort of guidance. I was just overwhelmed with the flood of emotions and at some point a friend of mine told me to try an app for managing and understanding my emotions.   
I tried it…  
Crazy, at the beginning I thought is something like a meditation - but then I created the therapy audio and it hit me.   
The app creates therapy audios on your negative emotions towards the positive ones you want - interesting concept if you would ask me.   
I made an audio on sadness and at some point in the audio it was explained that sadness appears when you perceive that you have lost something, like a state that was accessible before and now that my partner is gone I can’t acces it. And it guided me to feel the sadness in my body and to overcome it.   
I told all my friends about it - super grateful for it. It’s called Selftalk: Transform Within!

It kills me to see others in worse positions than I am. You matter. You all matter and it doesn't matter what your depression or suicidal thoughts tell you.,198,True,False,True,False,46,False,"I'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. Everyone I know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. Your life matters. I know it doesn't seem like it does, I know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.

&#x200B;

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

&#x200B;

You have to force yourself out of this. I know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? I don't think any of us enjoy it. Do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease? Vent in the comments of this post if you want. I don't mind.

Does anyone have any tips on not feeling so guilty over small accidents?,69,False,False,True,False,31,False,"Twice now at my job I have made small unintentional mistakes, that were fixed by others before they informed me of it, and both times it was in a neutral ""Just so you know for next time"" kind of way.

Went to the store today for the first time on my own volition (story),10,False,False,True,False,0,False,"So today I (19M) wanted to head down to this Giant Eagle close to my college campus to pick up a Visa gift card. I gathered 55 dollars and made my way to the car. I debated whether I should go but was like fuck it, I’m gonna at least drive done there (I have a bit of driving anxiety too). So I made it in the parking lot and I think “Hm, I’ll glad I drove done there but maybe I’ll just drive back to campus.” Then I was just like fuck it, and went inside. I searched for my gift card, which took a little bit of searching but I finally got it and went to a cashier. I didn’t want to do the self checkout because I’m illiterate with that kind of technology and didn’t have my debit card on me. But I finally got up to the cashier and paid, she said it was 55.95 and I said ok and starting putting my cash in, only to realize I didn’t have enough lmao. So I told her, she didn’t seem too thrilled but I guess also not mad. She just had to abort the transaction and I got my money back. 

I thought about maybe gathering more money and going back but turned down the idea. I’ll probably do that tomorrow. So although I didn’t get the Visa Gift card, I’m proud of myself for pushing myself to go up there. Again, I have a bit of driving anxiety too and had to drive in a busy parking lot. Feels amazing to have a little success like this.

Health Anxiety,1,False,False,True,False,2,False,"My health anxiety is so difficult to manage, especially after getting gastritis from a stressful event. I recently had constipation and that happened alongside severe back pain which was new for me as someone who experiences constipation fairly often. I began to spiral with my thoughts wondering if it's my kidneys or a spinal injury, even though I haven't I Jared myself. I keep thinking the worse case scenario and my sister and bil have been trying to get me to chill out. They keep telling me I'm fine and the back pain was because of the constipation and that I'll be fine with time.  For the most part, my constipation has improved, but my back pain is on and off and today I woke up feeling dizzy and dehydrated. I've been drinking water but I have no appetite. I'm forcing soup down and I had an ensure for an extra boost but I just feel so fatigued and light headed. I want to go to urgent care but everyone keeps saying ill be fine. I don't know what or who to trust and what to do. I feel like stress has caused me to lose the ability to handle even minor stressful things. Everything feels like an emergency but I feel especially bad today. I don't know what's anxiety and what's not. I can't tell if I need to go to the doctor or if it's something to treat at home and wait out. I have moments where I'm in pain but I feel like it's manageable and other times where I'm thinking this is how it ends. It's a crazy Rollercoaster.

How do you guys deal with the extra anxiety from health anxiety. It feels like way more than it should be and it's hard to function. Does anxiety cause all of these symptoms? Exacerbate them?
